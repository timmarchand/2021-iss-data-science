iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Awesome.,2018-06-27,the United Kingdom,5,11,"Due to a recent health decline, housework is now very painful. This has forced me to sit and watch in horror as the mountain of cat hair has built up. I hesitated for ages before making such a big financial investment, but I’m so glad I did. It’s strangely calming watching it trundle its way around and all I have to do is put the small stuff out of the way. It’s early days yet but zero problems so far.

My husband was saying this will be one of those again. Even he admitted he was wrong. Two massive cats and a small child in the house create always lots of mess. We live waiting for cleaners to come over and it took few hours for a house to look a mess again. Had no time to clean at all. Now we are rescued by the robot. The touch of the button before we are off to work and we just could not believe it cleaned the whole level and docked himself for the charge. All we need to do is to empty the dust collector.

My wife and I do not enjoy vacuuming and it doesn't get done often, until now, that is! I used to think robotic vacuum cleaners were a gimmick but after the first day that thought was quashed! We set Roomba to clean our whole house daily. At first it couldn't clean the whole house without needing emptied but 2 weeks on, it's now managing it which is a great sign as it means our house is getting cleaner! Our very tired old carpet is visibly cleaner and the pile is standing proud and taller, I kid you not. You honestly don't need to vacuum anymore apart from once a year behind things Roomba can't get behind. Or just move the furniture from time to time. We have it clean while we're at work and find it back at its base station fully recharged and asking to be emptied. It's like a very helpful pet! Even works on our deep pile new carpet with ease. If you hate cleaning, buy one!!",eng,0.8510227206391416,7,0.24048284002476528,184

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Breaks down quickly,2018-03-12,the United Kingdom,1,7,"So I have had a Roomba 980 for 3 weeks now. For the first 10 days it was great and I followed the manual for cleaning brushes, aeroforce blades etc. However, as of today it has developed a massive noise. Again I completed the whole dismantling, cleaning and assembling the machine again but the noise (high frequency crackling noise) continues. I am quite disappointed that such an expensive kit did not last very long. It has been cleaning marble flooring which is not heavy duty and should have lasted longer than this. I am returning it back to Amazon for refund.",eng,0.34641016151377546,3,-0.24639791008575504,98
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Very impressed,2017-09-14,the United Kingdom,5,2,"Bought this over the 360 eye for a number of reasons and have to say, having used for 6 months this is very very good.  I am always amazed at how much dust and fluff is in the bin, even after using the mains powered Dyson and thinking the carpet is clean. I use Android and have had no problems with the app at all. It cleans the whole downstairs floor area (short pile carpet) on max power without needing to recharge, around 50 mins cleaning, and navigates perfectly through the rooms and docks perfectly.  I do clear the floor first of toys and tuck any wires away before it goes out.  It will not do a deep clean around the edges but does sweep the edges at the end of the clean cycle. It reduces the need to use the mains vacuum by a substantial amount.  It is not cheap but feels like a product that has evolved and improved in its design culminating in the 980 (for now). For the price it needs to be great and in my experience I think it is. The 980 has exceeded my expectations, just do not expect it to completely replace a mains vacuum.",eng,0.6363961030678927,2,0.14311650908671875,198
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Been doing a great job for over a year,2017-11-27,the United Kingdom,5,4,"I’ve had the Roomba for over a year now (since Aug 2016), and have been very happy with it. Using scheduled runs during the day while everyone is out is great, and it can easily do a double run in our flat (two carpeted bedrooms, hardwood and tiles elsewhere) without skipping a beat.The only niggle is that it sometimes gets stuck in an awkward angle on the sloping legs of a Barcelona chair, but that’s very infrequent (once a month tops).",eng,0.16666666666666666,9,0.28304236590367154,83

I was disappointed to see it not be able to clean my medium shagginess carpets (just giving up when it should push a little in order to move on them), to find easily cleanable dirt near the walls (it seems it does not make a pass with the long brush by every wall), and especially to find out that I can't connect it to my Google Home, for no other reason than that I'm not a US customer.",eng,-1,1,0.09748679626014077,87

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Absolutely fantastic. Expensive but worth it.,2017-03-04,the United Kingdom,5,12,"Firstly, please note that I bought my Roomba 980 from John Lewis, who agreed to price match Tesco Direct and allowed me to collect (for free) from my local Waitrose the next day.So, right out of the box, it’s possible to have the Roomba 980 up and running in a matter of minutes. Once you’ve plugged your Home Base docking station’s power cord into a wall socket, all you have to do is remove the battery pull tab and yellow bin insert from the Roomba’s undercarriage, press the clearly marked ‘Clean’ button in top of the unit, and your automated vacuum will start cleaning your home immediately.Press the unit’s ‘Home’ button, and the Roomba 980 will stop everything and, in one of its most impressive acts of futuristic awesomeness, automatically guide itself over to its charging station like it’s following a homing beacon. It’ll also do this when it’s running low on battery or if its bin is full.Though this control method is already quite easy to manage, the Roomba 980 is also the first iRobot device that can be controlled via an iOS or Android app. Connecting the unit to the app is a cinch – the iRobot app will automatically detect your Wi-Fi network and ask if you want to connect your Roomba to it.The Roomba 980’s iAdapt 2.0 navigation sensors allow it to move around and clean an entire floor of your house without crashing into things or dropping down stairs or ledges. It will still bump into walls and furniture, but in a way that’s ever so gentle.Cleverly mapping your home’s layout as it cleans, iRobot’s vSLAM technology actually scans the environment around the Roomba 980 to memorise and create distinct visual landmarks. This helps it keep track of where it has already been, making clean up jobs more direct and efficient.Instead of forcing its way through things, the Roomba 980 will hug itself along obstructions, including chair legs, bicycle wheels or any other solid object that’s touching the floor, inching around them until it’s cleaned as much uncovered floor space as possible.In the box, you’ll also find a pair of battery-operated Dual Mode Virtual Wall Barriers. As the name implies, these act as a virtual wall that will keep the Roomba from crossing certain areas. For instance, if you don’t want the Roomba to enter a particular room, you can place one of these barriers down by the entrance. These are also great for keeping the device away from your ground-level pet food bowls.As expensive as it is, there’s no denying that iRobot’s Roomba 980 is a gloriously advanced automated vacuum. With its environment mapping and self navigation, the latest Roomba never ceases to impress – watching it automatically guide itself back to its charging station is always a delight. Though its app is a little on the sluggish side, and it struggles slightly when rolling over cables, every part of the Roomba 980 experience exudes quality. If vacuums do become sentient one day, it’s likely that they’ll aspire to be just like this one.",eng,0.8991095773009196,6,0.22144458883435156,529

Having the roomba allows us to get on with other things around the house. I definitely recommend it especially if you have busy lives.",eng,0.5303300858899106,2,0.3812674143113826,89

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Superb hoover. Brilliant tech. Set the schedule and forget about it.,2017-02-19,the United Kingdom,5,21,"Our Dyson upright hoover died and already owning an iRobot Scooba (which I still use almost every day) decided to buy the Roomba 980.The technology in the robot is what make it cut above the rest. This is no toy (although lots of fun to watch). Friends of ours purchased another robot from another company and after a few weeks have given up, the 980 is in a league of it’s own.Our layout is rather unusual and to make things more difficult, I put the charging station in a different room since I didn’t really want it on display. That means that the 980 has to navigate over a little ledge, into a small corridor, turn left into the living/eating area with a large rug in the living area, and then notice a kitchen off on the side. The floors are granite tiles.The robot has each time quite a bit of fun going over the ledge in both directions, but has yet to fail. However, the first few attempts weren’t as successful as I had hoped. The first challenge was the carpet. The problem is that my carpet has a black edge around it. I didn’t think about it when I read in the reviews that the 980 can’t handle black (it thinks that it’s the edge of a room and will fall). Being somewhat disappointed, I turned to the internet and found the solution was quite simple – simply stick a piece of white paper with sellotape and cover the sensors. I wouldn’t recommend doing this upstairs of course!Excellent. Problem one solved. Now to my next problem. Now the robot was getting stuck on my IKEA Poäng chair! Using one of the virtual walls  in “halo” mode solved that problem. And to my final problem…I wasn’t satisfied that the 980 was actually making it properly into the kitchen. On the app (available for iPhone and Android), it told me the amount of square feet that it was covering and it really wasn’t enough. I decided to put the robot in the living room to see if I would get better results. If necessary I was willing to move the docking station into the living room, but wasn’t over-enthusiastic about it.The battery wasn’t on full charge, but decided to see what would happen.Despite the fact that the robot didn’t start it’s run from the docking station, nevertheless, when it ran out of battery, it navigated itself back to the room with the docking station, replenished it’s charge and continued to complete it’s task.Now that’s impressive.We have the Roomba set to clean our downstairs every night (you can schedule one time per day) so you can decide on a Sunday to run at 11 am and Monday at 9 am etc.Emptying the Roomba is recommended after each run, but I am lazy and do so every week. The weekly maintenance takes about 5 minutes and the daily task of putting the Roomba in a good starting position (again this is only because I don’t want the robot in the living room) and the halo under that one chair takes me less than 2 minutes.A few more things that I noticed:1. Yesterday evening the house was a disaster and before settling down to watch TV decided to run the robot. I forgot to move a heater and watched the 980 go over some heavy wires and get tangled. It expertly untangled itself without any problem. It took about an hour to clean 42 sq. m. It picked up everything from popcorn off the floor to some breadcrumbs that I had dropped after it had already done the first pass in the kitchen (it comes back later to do a second pass and then finishes off by doing the edges).2. You do need some light for the robot to work. It uses the camera to reorient itself if it goes off course slightly. So if you are running the robot at night like we do, you will need to leave some lights on.3. The robot is of course noisy and when it goes on carpet get very noisy – but it also cleans very well.4. There is a very useful feature of spot cleaning. If you drop dirt on the carpet – say a child has come into play and emptied the contents of their shoes – sand, soil etc., on the carpet – you can put the robot on the dirty spot and press the spot clean button. No need for a full one-hour clean.5. My last point is something to consider – we do have a stair case and it has carpet on it. Obviously right now, no robot hoover can actually handle that, so I was forced to purchase a cheap pull along hoover to handle the stairs.This really is a superb product and worth the very high price. I did a lot of research and I recommend watching video reviews of the 980 on YouTube  actually picking up dirt off carpets etc. There is no point paying half the amount for a robot that doesn’t actually do what you want it to do.",eng,0.40841044195616044,11,0.07369216072877656,869

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Surprisingly effective,2018-07-04,the United Kingdom,4,4,"I bought this because we have 4 cats, and vacuuming was becoming a full time job. Set up was dead easy using the App, and equally easy to change the settings to schedule when the cleaner goes about its tasks.It's noisier than I expected, but then I just set it to go when no-one's in the house. You also have to organised about picking stuff up off the floor so it doesn't get interrupted or blocked. It also struggles with shag-pile rugs and can't make it over the lip of deeper pile rugs, which is a nuisance. (I had to rig up little 'ramps' so that it could climb onto one of my rugs, but even then it doesn't always make it!).It also can't make it under my dining room table if the chairs are on the floor, so if I want this area cleaned, then I put the chairs upside down on the table.Having said all that, I've been really pleased with how effective it is - It runs once a day over a big area (25 sq.m.), taking about 45mins to 1 hour. I don't think the job is necessarily as effective as a full-blown vacuum but this 'little and often' approach with the Roomba generally means we have very little dust and fur in evidence, which would otherwise be floating around the house making a mess.

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,- The programming feature is really nice! - you can change settings via the app ...,2017-03-08,Canada,4,16,"Pros:- The programming feature is really nice!- you can change settings via the app- the cord avoidance feature (similar to 800 series)- it actually is able to jump a little bit of height (I guess 1 or 2 cm jump between floor types)- the cliff detection works! very excited about that- I love how it finds an obstacle - like a chair leg, and instead of just reversing direction, it actually makes sure to clean all the way around it!! Because of this we don't mind leaving dining room chairs on the group, or the dogs toys - as we know the roomba will just work around it.Cons:- it's very loud! Luckily it has 2 settings - carpet boost ON or OFF. With it off, we can barely hear it from upstairs. With it on, (and our bedroom fan on) we can still hear the vacuum whine.- the bin sensors fill up very quickly. While this has a larger bin than previous versions, the carpet (wool) will shed alot. This can sometimes confuse the sensors, and it doesn't always make it 100% of the way into the bin. When we empty the bin, we have to make sure we pull out all the fibres.- It's gotten stuck at least 3 times in areas it shouldn't have (under slingback chairs, under the couch) but as we run it every night, we just find it in the morning and put it back- we have a drop off area from carpet to tile around our fireplace. The carpet bulges there quite a bit. The roomba falls off the carpet into the tile easily, but gets stuck in the tile area because it can't make the jump back up. I wonder why the programming allows it to go ""down"" a height more than it can go ""up""- it makes little noises every time you change the settings, which gets a little annoying if you are programming the entire schedule for the week- expensive!!!",eng,0.20049796015921226,13,0.09675378359279828,321
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Great but don't expect perfection.,2017-01-20,Canada,5,61,"Pros- iRobot HOME app is stable to use. I can view the run time, jobs completed, square feet cleaned etc.- Picks up most dirt particles. I tested this by shaking out an old carpet to coat my hardwood floor with a layer of dust and dirt as well as pouring glitter on the floor. I could visibly see streaks of clean floor every time the Roomba passed over the area but it will miss a few bits here and there.- If the Roomba is stuck somewhere and the battery isn't dead, I can click the locate button on my app to make it sing for me and go find it.- The cliff sensors seem to be working fine because my Roomba hasn't taken the leap of death to commit suicide at the stairs. One day it might try because it's upset with all unpaid slave labour I make it do, but it hasn't tried as of yet.- Forces you to create a new habit of decluttering your floor and remove obstacles for the Roomba to clean. Once the Roomba starts up, I see my dog scrambling to get all his toys back into the bin.- The 2 lighthouses that comes with the Roomba used to create virtual walls are powered by normal AA batteries.Cons- iRobot HOME app for controlling the Roomba doesn't have push notifications.- There currently are no ways for you to view the map that the Roomba has created while vacuuming on the app for security reasons. Personally I wanted to know exactly where in the house it cleaned.- Roomba has trouble transitioning from hardwood floor to my 1/2"" high-pile rug and will think it is a wall. I uploaded a photos of my Roomba refusing to go up onto a carpet.- Sometimes Roomba will slow down before bumping into walls and furniture but most of the time it will just stupidly bash into things at its regular operating speed.- If you have light carpets or a bath mat, you will need to clean that yourself and move it out of the way. It will be too light for the Roomba to go on top of it. My bathroom mat for example just kept getting pushed around. I uploaded a photo for this issue as well.VerdictThe Roomba 980 isn't by any means perfect or totally autonomous. It will miss some particles here and there but it should be no problem if you schedule it to clean the house once a day and you manually clean the floor once a month. While the Roomba is pricy, it to me was a time saver. Time is money so purchasing it is a decision that I don't regret (yet). Another way I like to think of it is it would have costed significantly more if I were to pay for a housecleaning service.",eng,-0.9058311376851648,5,0.06822980503101903,472
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,"The answer to the question, ""What to do with you _hate_ vacuuming?""",2017-02-16,Canada,4,4,"I've just moved, and after cleaning out my old apartment I vowed a mighty oath I'd not get so behind in vacuuming again. Knowing I'm a lazy sod, I bought the Rumba.It's drop dead amazing. Except for very TIGHT corners, it covers an average-sized room in 20 minutes or so. I've found it helpful to pick up or move what furniture I can (remember in grade school you were asked to put your chairs on your desks at the end of the day?) so as to help the little guy out, but face it, if you were vacuuming yourself you'd move the chairs anyway.I've decided I'd sooner do the house one room at a time. I've supposedly got the Roomba set to stop when it's garbage-storage is full, but I'm not sure it's doing that. One room at a time means the (admittedly very limited) dustbin doesn't get completely full.It's very efficient about picking up floor stuff. I'm sure it's not hurting the carpet; when I empty the dustbin when it's just done a yellow carpet, the lint and such is grey, not yellow. So it's legitimately getting dirt.The manual is a little intimidating about how often you'll need new parts. After seeing the progress bars on the app, I don't think that'll be a problem after all. The air filters in particular look like they'd fill up fast, but a quick vacuum with a ""real"" vacuum seems to get the in-use filter quite clean again.It's not quiet; it sounds like a vacuum cleaner. That's perfectly forgivable.The ""edge detection"" didn't work as well as it might have when it encountered stairs. It didn't fall DOWN the stairs, but it did stop with about a quarter of itself over the edge and call for help. I put it down to the stairs being carpeted, and the carpet is contiguous with the floor carpeting. It'd likely do better on bare steps.It's awfully good at getting into nooks and crannies, but there are simply some corners it's never going to fit into. OK, a little manual touch-up is OK.It's awfully good at going under things. When it disappeared under the bed and under the couch, I was a little worried. I need not have been.The shift from high power to lower power when moving from carpet to hard floor is neat to hear, and more proof that it's really beating that rug.By default, the Roomba vacuums through a room twice. I've turned that off; since I'm using it on a schedule, it'll stay caught up on dirt without doing the same job twice.The light-emitting electronic barriers work just fine though you have to remember the Roomba might just sneak into another room by going under, say, a couch, and avoiding the electronic barrier you've set up.I'm mildly sorry I can't drive it from the app, to clean up a specific mess. There's a button (""Spot clean"") I think that makes the robot just go over the area it's been placed in, but manual control would be better.It was hard to get past the price tag; but I _hate_ vacuuming, and now I get to watch a faithful servant do it. I've named mine ""Hired Girl"" from the Heinlein novel, ""A Door Into Summer"".",eng,-0.21650635094610968,12,-0.011649594940316685,557

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,iRobot has taken the Roomba 980 to greater levels of intelligence and performance.  Just wish that collection bin was larger!,2017-07-06,Canada,4,2,"I bought this for my wife to reduce the amount of daily cleaning that she had to do.  We had a roomba several years ago and while it did help with daily upkeep, it didn't hold up for very long, even with regular routine maintenance.  The old roomba was simple and very short on intelligence back then.Fast-forward many years later to the new 980 series.  This little guy actually has gained a significant level of AI and is definitely more advanced than your grandma's Roomba!  Among the many new features that I really appreciate:A camera for it to lean and navigate the home landscape instead of simply running around and ramming into everythingWifI connectivityExtensive scheduling capabilityVery slick app for programming scheduling and overall management of this device.If I can come up with any con (that still exists) about this modern day version of the Roomba, it's that the collection bin for what it effectively picks up is still as small as before.  This still translates to repeated trips to your Roomba during a large area cleaning cycle to empty it's car ash try-like collection bin.  The good thing however is that with the mobile app and audible messaging system on the robot, you can at least quickly locate and understand why it has stopped.  On the mobile app it displays a very visible message indicating that the bin has to be emptied.In defense of iRobot, the intent of this device is that we regularly run it thereby reducing the amount of mess that the little guy has to collect.  That being the case if it's run regularly, then the bin won't fill as quickly.  However if you do have a pet or pets, it doesn't take long for animal hair, dirt, odd bits of treats of food to collect.  So even regular runs still will likely require 'collection bin maintenance'.  At least the robot is doing most of the work now!Another nice aspect of this robot now 'being connected'. is that you can even remotely kick off a cleaning cycle even if you're not home!  To me this is a huge added benefit, especially if you're not committed to scheduling automatic cleaning runs.  I also like the new movable barrier radar blocks that you can use to prevent the Roomba from entering an area that you want it to stay out of.  The invisible barriers can either be a point-to-point straight line or a point-to-point semi-circle (to say cordon off a pet feeding area).Finally, I'm very impressed with the overall user friendliness and function of the mobile app.  You can monitor operation, review past cleaning jobs, actually manage the robot (suspend, resume, cancel an active job, send it back to the charging dock), set up cleaning schedule on a daily basis and even specify the start time.  I also forgot to mention that if the robot runs low on power during its cleaning cycle, it will send itself back to charge and resume the job where it left off once charging is complete.  Pretty impressive.So yes, this is not your grandma's Roomba.  It's smarter, more manageable and programmable, more efficient, definitely more effective than past generations.  Being a Tech guy, I can appreciate and respect the work that the engineers at iRobot have put into improving their army of robotic cleaners!  The only thing that I wish they would design is a bigger collection bin for those of us that may not do the best job of running our robots more frequently!  Not they haven't now provided us with the tools to automate that process!  Good job iRobot.  You got me back on board!",eng,0.3532583834200599,19,0.2554147475279957,617

I've owned a cheap vacuum robot before and Roomba does not bump into objects in it's path as often. I watched it clean around my computer chair with 6 legs and it went in between all the legs. Impressive! I also saw it squeeze into places I was sure it would never get out of. Wrong! My previous robot had a tendency of getting lost under a chair with 4 legs - not Roomba.If you're choosing between 980 and 960: I don't have carpets but I still went for 980. With 980 you have an option to use ""performance clean"" which enables more powerful suction on all surfaces. I have it on by default because I can. I can downgrade to ""eco mode"" on the fly from an app if i'm in the house and i want roomba to work quietly.Top mounted camera is a privacy concern. I hope iRobot is safekeeping our private data in the cloud with all those security breaches going it should be a priority for them. Good thing is the camera is pointed forward meaning the camera will stare at the wall when roomba is docked.I love the reports roomba sends to my phone after each clean.

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Absolutely worth it!!,2018-12-07,Canada,5,0,We LOVE this thing. He has been named Victor and he diligently cleans the main floor of our house 3 days a week.When he first arrived at our door I was a bit apprehensive from some of the horror stories I have read about them falling down the stairs or spreading a mess left by a pet around the house. So the first time we used him I must have watched home for about 1.5 hours as he  meticulously started vacuuming the floors. It was quite amazing to watch as he went line by line up and down the rooms then returned to do all the edges. When it came to the stairs I will admit I got nervous but he didn’t miss a beat and went right to the edge and back again. He gets places I rarely do (under the couch) and is always getting more dirt. Our dog doesn’t bother with Victor much occasionally bumps him with her nose if he rest to close and it just turns and goes the other way.Victor has been a part of our home for almost 2 years and we simply wipe his sensors when we empty his bin. I will be ordering some new filters and roller brushes because they have worn down.Would definitely recommend this to anyone and I have. My parents have a lower model that just bounces around only 1 room at a time then requires to be moved but the 900 series is fantastic and can clean the entire floor of our house while we’re at work.,eng,0.7794228634059949,3,0.06558635713673233,262

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Does not pickup hair on low-pile carpet,2019-01-25,Canada,2,0,"Firstly, I have an odd fascination with vacuum cleaners. My spouse thinks I'm crazy. So you can imagine my delight when ordering my first robot vacuum - the Roomba 980. You can probably also imagine my dismay when it really did not do a very good job of its primary purpose - cleaning.The good:- The package itself was great, with everything you need - including a spare filter and edge brush + 2 virtual walls.- The app is very easy to use - and the mapping feature (to see where its cleaned, not to specify where to go) is handy.- The vacuum itself was relatively smart. It was able to circumnavigate obstructions well.- On hardwood floors, it did an okay job cleaning. It would inevitably have to do a second pass to get some items it spat out w/ the edge brush... but I was expecting that kind of thing.- On our high-pile area rug, it did an okay job cleaning. It did occasionally leave behind a bit of hair or a couple things here and there, but I was also not expecting perfection.The meh:- While the Roomba could skirt around obstacles, in the month I had to test, it could not figure out how to get into my kitchen all but one time. My kitchen is separated from my dining room by a normal door-sized entry way, but it clearly confused the Roomba almost all the time. (Weird that it did make its way in there once)- Where our light-coloured area rug ends at our dark wood floor under our couches, the Roomba thought there was a ""cliff"" and it would get stuck there repeatedly. I would understand if that happened occasionally, but we had to ""rescue"" it during all but one cleaning.The bad:- On our low-pile carpet in our basement, the Roomba 980 did a terrible job. I've read a bunch of reviews of the 980 being able to pickup hair etc without issue. But I've since also read as many reviews saying the opposite. And the latter was my experience - the Roomba did pick up some hair for sure, because it was tangled around its ""agitators"" - but it also left behind a lot. I mean, a lot. i.e., it would collect it somewhat, and then leave it behind.If I had more time to test, I might change my tune... but given, ultimately, 3 weeks to test, I cannot recommend this vacuum. My vacuum-loving heart is sad today as I return it to Amazon.",eng,0,8,0.030387249299043084,416

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,"For $1000, I expected much better cleaning performance.  I returned mine.",2016-07-20,Canada,2,9,"I had the Roomba 980 for approximately a month, and used it several times a week.  Ultimately, I decided to return it.  The cleaning performance was ""just ok"".  I have a 2-bedroom condo with hardwood floors, and 2 area rugs.  On the hardwood, the Roomba did a decent job - though, there were times I would watch it pass over larger dirt particle without picking it up.  On the rugs, the performance wasn't amazing.  While it would get the large particles, upon closer inspection, I could still see smaller dirt particles in the rug - especially for the higher pile rug.  For a $1000 machine, I expected much better cleaning.  I can do a way better job with my old vacuum.  I really liked the idea of not having to vacuum again, but I don't think this is the product for me.  I can see using this to do a few passes in the week, and then using a 'real' vacuum for a weekly deeper clean....but for $1000 I just couldn't justify that.  I may look into one of the less expensive Roombas, or just wait until the technology improves.  I did find the cleaning rollers a little thin/flimsy - perhaps the previous models have better rollers with brushes.  To be sure, I followed all of the maintenance advice.  I cleaned the rollers, filter, the cameras, bin, etc.",eng,0.6682501493236617,10,0.12794193530891593,223
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,1 Year Review Appended To My Original Review.,2016-10-01,Canada,5,9,"(YEAR IN REVIEW) Well it's been about a year of owning this and I feel I'd like to add some advice! My Roomba is still going strong albeit with a couple tweaks here and there! If you think you can buy any Roomba and it'll work for you like a set and forget then I'm here to tell ya it's not that simple. You should expect that if you own carpet you must clean the roller bushings, front wheel axle, bottom sensors and bin frequently. If this scares you don't let because it's all really easy and there's how to pictures clearly shown in the Roomba App that walks you through and then there's Youtube to really expand on it. Mostly it's simple wiping and lint balls that you tug off the rollers BUT has to be done because the machine will not clean or the side won't spin etc. It's hard to break the device as mine has worked tirelessly without much fuss.Today I noticed that my Roomba was moving across the floor in sporadic movement, like it was going fast-slow-fast-slow then slow...I knew there was something different so I went online and found that another user posted a fix. Here's what you should expect with yours as it will no doubt happen to you over time. There's 10 small philips screws located underneath along the front bumper. Simply remove them and pull the rim off taking care as there's 2 small wires that attach to the front round sensor. Take a damp cloth and wipe the dust off the inside of the bumper particularly on the sensors (those clear plastic sensors you will not miss them). The sensors shoot a signal out of the front bumper to detect objects, walls etc and when they become very dirty they send a a signal to Roomba to go slow as an object is about to be bumped!After you wipe just line up the screw holes and screw it on and your back in business. If you happen to have an air compressor it's likely that shooting a strong stream of air would likely work without removing the bumper.Other than that I've only had to replace the side brush and am still using the original HEPA filter as I use an air compressor once in awhile to really blow it out. To date according to the app I've cleaned a total Area of 234900 Sq.Feet and Total Hours Used is 587 Hours 23 Minutes, Total Jobs Roomba ran are 435 Jobs. My average square feet cleaning of my house is 800 sq.feet and it takes 1h40mins to complete the job with Edge Clean Feature On.I've bought 2 Roomba's as gifts since buying this one, Roomba 614 and Roomba 870. Both are running strong for the people I've bought them for and they LOVE them. I particularly was impressed with them in action and feel they clean very good however the camera mapping feature found on the 900 series is totally worth the extra cost if you can afford it. Having the vacuum move in straight lines across the house is much more logical but the random cleaning patterns found in the lower series models still clean effectively and pretty much don't eventually miss a spot.Back to my original review below...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ya that's right you heard me, I jumped in at over $1000.00CDN clams to alleviate my A-D-Disorder after watching my recently purchased and way cheaper hockey puck clone vacuum ""bounce"" around my pad. It actually cleaned very well as I'm 70% vinyl plank / 28% hardwood however that bounce clean random over here over there thing...So I said I need a cleaner that logically maps it's course and I'm going to say to you try it. In fact if you want purchase a lesser model to test cause it may work well for you.What I realized very quickly is that the 980 for me returned to its base like the Men of Stalag 13 who were ordered back to their bunker by Colonel Wilhelm Kline! It marches right to within seconds to charge whereas my previous misdemeanour stopped at every corner bar, ""bumping"" it's way inebriated back along each wall to the base. ""bump"" ""bump """" bump """" bump ""My curiosity was raised today while in the city (I've only had the 980 2 days and live on a farm), I started a remote clean session from the app and it completed successful and even had to recharge itself at one point to complete the clean. I came home this evening to view the small miracle... Priceless!",eng,0,7,0.20221823274202164,762
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Intelligent mais...,2016-12-02,Canada,4,8,"C'est mon deuxième Roomba et ce modèle est incroyablement plus intelligent que l'autre. Il est également beaucoup plus diplomate avec mes murs et mes meubles. Il ramasse très bien les poils de mes deux chiens et il le fait beaucoup plus rapidement que l'autre. C'est aussi beaucoup plus facile de nettoyer les nouveaux rouleaux en caoutchouc que sur mon ancien modèle avec les poils.J'aurais cependant aimé un réservoir un peu plus grand pour la poussière. Le robot a aussi un peu de difficulté à aller à sa borne de recharge tout seul. La borne n'est pas bien fixée au sol et le robot la pousse constamment. Mon ancien Roomba avait le même problème alors ce n'est rien de nouveau. Mais pour un produit de ce prix-là, c'est étrange que la compagnie n'ait pas encore réglé ce problème. Je retrouve donc constamment mon robot déchargé et je dois attendre des heures avant de pouvoir l'utiliser.L'application iPhone est une belle idée mais, à mon sens, elle est incomplète. Je m'amuse à mettre en marche le robot à distance mais c'est plus un gadget que quelque chose d'utile. Je m'attendais à pouvoir contrôler le robot à partir du téléphone et avoir une option pour voir le trajet du Roomba dans un espèce de plan modélisé de ma maison. Rien de ça. Même pas de photos disponibles à partir de la caméra.En conclusion, j'adore la navigation intelligente de mon nouveau Roomba. En soi, cette seule amélioration justifie son achat mais je trouve tout de même que iRobot aurait pu faire beaucoup mieux pour l'application et la borne de recharge.",fra,0.7071067811865475,2,0.01927517172862799,269
iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Great Product,2016-06-11,Canada,5,3,"Works great!!!  I love watching the little guys run around and vacuum the floor for me.  I say little guys as I bought 2.  One for upstairs and one for downstairs.  It's great to be able to connect with my smart phone.  I was out the other day and remembered I had forgotten to start them before leaving.  When I went on the phone to the iRobot app, I was able to start both and come home to a freshly vacuumed house.  I also have the option of scheduling them to start at a certain time each day.  I couldn't be more impressed.  It has a built in camera and GPS.  It would be kind of neat to be able to access the camera and be able to look through the house when I am out, just to make sure all is ok.  Another added benefit is that the do not scare my dog.  My old upright vacuum, as soon as I started it up he would bark furiously and try to bite it, as if the thing had murdered his whole family.  With the Roomba, he could care less, unless it bumps into him, then he gets up and walks away.  It's not whisper quiet when it works, but it is not overwhelming and you can carry on a conversation.",eng,0.35355339059327373,2,0.1084446534336199,220

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Shockingly good!,2016-06-26,Canada,4,2,"This little machine does an amazing job and picked up far more dirt and dust that I would have imagined. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars, is that when it does carpets (which it cleans very well) it leaves really ugly tire track lines everywhere on the carpet. Where a regular vacuum leaves marks, there is some order them, and they appear clean if that makes sense. The robot kind of makes it look like someone has been playing with a toy tank on your carpet all day. Having said that, I bought it to mainly do the hardwood floors, and it does a terrific job. The ability to use wifi and start it from your phone is awesome too. I was out of town and started it cleaning about 3 hours before I arrived home to a spotless house.

It is light years ahead of our 1st generation.

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,Fantastic unit,2016-06-01,Canada,5,3,"This is a fantastic cleaning device. This is well worth the cost. I usually have to do 2-passed to clean an entire floor.... read that again... an entire floor. Not a single room, a whole floor. This thing is awesome.Do note that you will have to move items out of the way or raise objects if you want the Roomba to go underneath something smaller than itself. Otherwise, the Roomba will do the job. It will go under your couches, tables, beds, and into tight corners (again, it will only go under items that are higher than itself.) And heck, it will even go recharge itself when it's done. Shoot, it will do that even if it isn't done cleaning and then will pick up where it finished last and will complete the job. Awesome!The upkeep on the unit is fairly straightforward as well. iRobot provides you with a few spare items when it comes time for replacement.Very happy to have made this purchase.

iRobot ROOMBA980 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,It cleans.,2017-03-02,Canada,5,4,"I started off by buying the Roomba 380T.  The robot floor mop.  I was so impressed with it, that I decided to make the jump and get the vacuum as well.I may have grown up as a nerd, but what little boy hasn't dreamed of having a robot house keeper?  Our roomba (Will Sweepin) transitions between our tile floors, hardwood floors and carpeted areas without issue.  It kicks into heavy duty suction mode on the carpet, and is quieter on the hard surfaces.  It somehow senses 'dirty' areas, and will make multiple passes to get all of the dust and dirt off the floor.  I was shocked the first time I emptied the dust bin.  SO MUCH DIRT!Did I mentioned Will Sweepin is wifi enabled?  That's right, I've got an app on my phone where I can tell it to start, or stop cleaning.  I can set schedules up so it vacuums ever day at 2pm.  It gives me statistics of the last run - how many square feet were cleaned, how long it took to complete, and how many extra dirty areas it encountered.My wife gives me a rough time that I'm so excited about a vacuum cleaner,  but a robot house keeper!

I don't have a dirty home, this is a defect. It would have been returned for a full refund if only I had kept the Amazon box. Because I didn't keep the box I've had to work with iRobot customer service. It's been 1.5 weeks now and the best they'll do (rather than fixing the issue) is to replace the unit with a Roomba 880.

It had the dirt detection, which led to the roomba going in circles (!) until no dirt detected. It was shorter in height, went under more things. Handled transitions like a star. Cleaned to walls and along same. Side sweepers robust. No batteries for old one 😢 It would've been 5 star, even today.This model doesn't have dirt detection. It runs gaily over dirt and bounces over the carpet/tile transitions like it's waiting for takeoff instructions. You can touch a button to make it turn in a circle, ONCE. Keep pressing button like a video game  I watched with popcorn in hand as small bits of cat food was spat out to the sides. No vacuuming in transitioning areas. The model is too large for transitions, it rocked like a flat rocker. Admittedly, my transitions are 15 years old, and a bit bulky, but still.  The side sweeps are not robust enough. They are too long, possibly too narrow, not enough individual  plastic swipers(?) in a bundle. It ignores the baseboards. Fear perhaps? It takes a lot longer to clean with this model in same apartment.It evidently comes with a remote control. I don't know if I should bother following up on that.Good things, it does pick up cat fur. It will eventually find home base.Don't buy it. It's a lemon for the price and inability to clean. Try one of the cheaper ones.",eng,-0.3858585042329734,10,0.039827048277963184,247
