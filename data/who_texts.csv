Accelerate action to prevent and control non-communicable diseases: WHO,2021-09-10,"SEAR/PR/1765Kathmandu - The World Health Organization has urged Member countries in South-East Asia Region to accelerate efforts to prevent and control non-communicable diseases which account for two-third of all deaths in the Region while also increasing the risk of severe COVID-19.“The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the vulnerabilities of people living with non-communicable diseases. In addition to the increased risk of severe disease and death, disruption in essential services threatens to slow down progress and even reverse the gains in controlling NCDs,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, at the Regional Committee meeting.Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension etc, is one of the flagship priorities of Dr Khetrapal Singh. Since 2014 member countries have been making concerted efforts, implementing multi-sectoral plans, providing, and scaling up NCD services at the primary health care level, promoting physical activity, taxing sugary drinks, taking multiple action to control tobacco use, promote mental health, among others. “We need to address NCDs and include them as an integral part of pandemic preparedness and response. This will help establish mechanisms for uninterrupted access to NCD services during emergencies, and reduce risk of serious health complications,” the Regional Director said.In view of the continuing challenges, Member countries discussed extending the Regional Action Plan for Prevention and Control of NCDs to meet SDG 2030 targets.The Member countries also discussed integrated eye care and oral health and developing Regional Action Plans for them. Poor oral health is an important public health concern, with oral cancer being among top five cancers. The Region also has one of the highest prevalence of visual impairment and blindness globally.There is some evidence of decline in the prevalence of blindness and moderate-to-severe visual impairment in the Region between 1990 and 2015; however, prevalence continues to be higher than the global average and coverage for effective cataract surgery remains below target. A situation analysis in 2020 of oral health policies showed some progress but also substantial gaps towards achieving the 2025 goals.Nearly half of the deaths due to NCDs occur prematurely between 30 and 69 years of age. A quarter of the adult population in the Region suffers from hypertension and every twelfth adult has diabetes.The Member countries discussed developing a regional NCD Implementation Roadmap 2022–2030 to provide operational guidance on “how to” sustain gains, accelerate action in areas that need greater emphasis and pilot innovative approaches in the Region to achieve SDG Target 3.4."
"Countries in WHO South-East Asia Region endorse health promoting schools, safe school operations during pandemic",2021-09-13,"SEAR/PR/1766Kathmandu - The Member countries of WHO South-East Asia Region resolved to work towards making ‘every school a health promoting school’, while also committing to safe school operations during the pandemic.“Schools have an important role in promoting healthy lifestyles, life-long healthy behaviors and to nurture human capital for sustainable development of any society. We need a whole-of-government approach to ensure children from all socio-economic background, including those with special needs, benefit from healthy schools,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region at the Regional Committee meeting.Adopting a resolution at the Regional Committee meeting to revitalize school health and health promoting schools, Member countries expressed concern over school closure during the ongoing pandemic, its impact on learning, growth and health of young children and adolescents.  Member countries also deliberated on the need to ensure safe reopening and operationalization of schools during the ongoing pandemic.  At the five-day meeting 6 – 10 September, the Member countries agreed to develop an integrated Regional Action Plan on viral hepatitis, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, aligned with WHO’s global and 2030 SDGs targets.Other highlights of the Regional Committee meeting included a declaration signed by Member countries, at a ministerial round table, to take lessons from the pandemic and strengthen health system resilience to ensure health security and achieve universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals for health.Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee addressed the ministerial round table, emphasizing on the need to ensure quality of health care services.WHO and Member countries of South-East Asia Region discussed further strengthening of health emergency security systems to be better prepared for future health emergencies.The meeting also discussed enhancing routine immunization coverage along with continuing efforts to rapidly increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage.Accelerating efforts to prevent and control the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, action being taken for measles and rubella elimination and progress on universal health coverage, were some of the other Regional flagship priorities deliberated upon at the meeting.The annual governing body meeting, hosted by Nepal this year, was held virtually for the second consecutive year due to the pandemic.For more information on issues and Regional Committee meeting –https://www.who.int/southeastasia/about/governance/regional-committee/seventy-fourth-session"
End violence against women: WHO,2021-11-26,"By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia One in three experience physical and/or sexual violence in her lifetime, shows WHO’s new estimates, launched in March 2021. Most of this occurs as intimate partner violence. Estimates suggest the South-East Asia Region ranks second highest, at around 33%. Such violence has serious health impacts, both immediate and long term, including injuries, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and unplanned pregnancies as well as mental health problems. These place violence against women among today’s priority public health issues.The WHO South-East Asia Region joins activists and partners around the world in marking the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. The annual campaign aims to strengthen awareness and action to end violence against women. On its 30th anniversary of this annual campaign, we join the call: “Orange the World: END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN NOW!” Such violence only tends to increase during emergencies and epidemics, resulting in higher risks to the health and safety of women and girls. Evidence suggests that violence against women has increased during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The exacerbation of violence against women can be regarded as “the invisible pandemic” accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic. This is so for many reasons—limitations on movement keep women isolated from support and in close proximity with their perpetrators, often alongside increased economic and psychological stress. Women have been disproportionately affected by loss of livelihoods, increasing their economic vulnerability and dependence, and by school closures. Their unpaid work burdens have increased dramatically. This increased vulnerability comes at a time when the pandemic has disrupted social protection services, such as hotlines, shelters and legal aid—and disrupted vital sexual and reproductive health services, often the first point of contact for survivors of violence.The health sector is a critical part of a multisectoral strategy to prevent and respond to violence against women.First, health policymakers and managers must strengthen the capacity of the health system and providers and ensure  continuity, adequate resourcing and appropriately adapted delivery of services for survivors as part of essential health services. Health facilities should identify information about locally available services for survivors (e.g., hotlines, shelters, rape crisis centers, counselling), including opening hours, contact details and whether these can be offered remotely, and establish referral links. Health providers, once aware of the issue and its implications, should offer medical treatment as well as first line support, such as empathetic listening, asking about needs, and connecting survivors to support.Second, the health sector has a role to play, with other sectors and stakeholders, in preventing violence against women and girls. Prevention is a continuum. Most primary prevention strategies can be implemented outside the health sector – in communities, in schools, through mass media. But secondary and tertiary prevention take place after women have experienced or are experiencing violence. Such women may seek health care, even if they do not disclose the violence. Here is where health care providers have a key role to play. If health-care providers are alert to identifying such women early – in early stages of the violence or before it becomes very severe – and offer appropriate care and responses, then they could prevent or reduce recurrence of such violence. Health care providers can also incorporate messages about prevention in health promotion activities. Third, the health sector has a role to play in advocating for, developing and implementing evidence-informed policies and strategies for gender-based violence prevention and response. More and better data are needed, and these must be collected in ethical and safe ways and consistent with survivor-centred principles.Community members can also help increase awareness, stay in touch with survivors in safe ways, and discreetly offer information and support.WHO plays a key role in bringing attention to violence against women and girls as a public health and gender equality issue, including in humanitarian settings, by: building the evidence; developing guidelines; encouraging political will and accountability and strengthening country capacity of health systems and providers. WHO has resources for women survivors of violence, people who are concerned that someone they know is experiencing violence, and for those working across the healthcare system and in humanitarian settings.This year, WHO again joins its partners to build gender-responsive health and social protective systems and for the elimination of violence against women. During the 16 Days, WHO and UNFPA’s regional office for Asia and the Pacific are training health facility managers and policy-makers in three countries, namely, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, in strengthening health sector capacity to respond to VAW, through a series of 6 online workshops. On 30 November, WHO, along with UN Women’s and UNFPA’s Regional Offices for Asia and the Pacific, will host an online event to disseminate the updated prevalence estimates on intimate partner violence and sexual violence in the Region. The event will also discuss how better data could be used to strengthen policies and actions to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.The 16 Days campaign, which ends on Human Rights Day (10 December), reminds us that women’s rights are human rights and we should do all we can to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. Let’s resolve to redouble our efforts to prevent and respond to the pandemic of violence against women—and keep women and girls everywhere safe."
"Health and Education Ministers, heads of partner agencies commit to 
health promoting schools for all in WHO South-East Asia Region",2021-10-12,"SEAR/PR/1769New Delhi - To build back better from the ongoing pandemic, health and education ministers of countries in WHO South-East Asia Region, and heads of UN agencies today committed to Health Promoting Schools for healthier generations and societies, and for schools to remain operational during public health emergencies and be resilient and well prepared for future emergencies.“The pandemic is a strong reminder of the importance of maintaining strong education systems that support the interlinked objectives of education and health for all children and adolescents leaving no one behind, in normal circumstances as well as during emergency situations like this pandemic,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director WHO South-East Asia, who convened a meeting of heads of partner agencies UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF and WFP, and health and education ministers from the Region on Health Promoting Schools. At the three-day inter-ministerial meeting that began this morning, health and education ministers from countries in WHO South-East Asia Region adopted a ‘Call to Action’ to scale up the implementation of comprehensive school health programmes that promote the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents.As a prelude to the ministerial meeting, the Regional leadership of UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP, WHO held a Summit and deliberated on strengthening school health programmes in the Region and signed a ‘Joint UN statement on strengthening education, school health, nutrition and well-being’ to collectively advocate for a healthier generation and provide harmonized joint technical support to countries. The Health Promoting School approach aims at advancing health, nutrition, mental health and the overall wellbeing of school-age children and adolescents, teachers and other staff members. As children and adolescents spend most of their formative years in schools, promoting healthy behavior from early childhood through the school setting will benefit their immediate and later health in their adult life, as well as the health and wellbeing of their families and wider communities.“The pandemic has exacerbated inequities and is disproportionately affecting the most marginalized and disadvantaged children in the region. Children are learning less and numerous health and nutrition services that were once provided from schools have stopped. School closures and isolation have taken a severe toll on children’s mental health and is exposing them to exploitation and harm. We must act urgently to safely reintroduce children back to school while making sure learning continues uninterrupted for children everywhere,” said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia.With the pandemic and prolonged school closures significantly impacting education, health, and nutrition, the Member countries and partners discussed prioritizing reopening of schools, where possible, and their safe operations and preparedness for future outbreaks. “‘Building forward better’ from COVID-19, and pursuing a mission to recover education, requires us to rethink how we deliver quality and inclusive education to all children and adolescents in the Asia-Pacific region. Among other things, this necessitates urgent investment in school health and nutrition programmes and creating the overall conditions for learners to lead healthy lives,” said Shigeru Aoyagi, Director, UNESCO Asia and Pacific Regional Bureau for Education.Adequate public health and social measures should be ensured while reopening schools such as wearing of masks, physical distancing, provisions of soap and running water to facilitate hand washing and use of open and well-ventilated spaces.  Measures should be in place to immediately control any outbreak in the school along with long-term preparedness plan to deal with future emergencies.Member countries and partner agencies discussed measures to enhance collaboration between health, education, and other relevant ministries, local governments and stakeholders including adolescents to ensure implementation of the Health Promoting Schools initiative.“For many of the millions of students across the Asia region who receive school meals, it’s often the most substantial and nourishing meal they have each day,” said John Aylieff, WFP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific. “WFP welcomes the renewed commitment of countries in the region to give their children access to the nutrition they need to grow, mentally and physically. We have an opportunity to strengthen our school systems so that no child is forced to drop out of school because of hunger or illness again.”The initiative also supports the immediate need to continue nutrition and health services in schools, foster youth engagement for safe reopening and safe operations of schools and deliver an integrated school curriculum including adolescent sexual and reproductive health for enhanced health literacy and life skills.  “As children traverse the journey from childhood to adolescence, they must have a conducive environment in schools which support them to make informed choices on life-changing matters, including some of the most personal issues in their lives. When young people are equipped with skills to make informed decisions and exercise their rights, they are able to realize their fullest potential and contribute to society meaningfully as responsible adults”, said Björn Andersson, Regional Director of UNFPA Asia and the Pacific. The global standards for health promoting schools and its implementation were developed collaboratively by WHO, UNESCO, and expert groups to support health and education as a community-centered approach. WHO and UNESCO launched a new initiative “Making Every School a Health Promoting School” on 22 June 2021 led by the Director-General of WHO and UNESCO.The Health Promoting Schools initiative is expected to serve over 2.3 billion school-age children and 362 million adolescents (10–19 years) in the WHO South-East Asia Region and will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the fields of education and health."
"Health Ministers commit to renew, accelerate efforts to end TB in South-East Asia",2021-10-26,"SEAR/PR/1770New Delhi - The Minsters of Health of countries in WHO South-East Asia Region today committed to renew and accelerate efforts to end tuberculosis, in view of the pandemic disrupting services and leading to increase in TB cases in the already high-burden Region.  “Despite being a preventable and treatable, TB kills more than a million people every year, almost half of them in the WHO South East-Asia Region. We must intensify effort towards ending TB,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom, Director-General, WHO, addressing a High-Level Meeting for Renewed TB Response.Inaugurating the meeting, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, said, “Immediate steps are needed to scale-up preventive, diagnostic and treatment services for TB, and significantly bolster social protection measures while specifically addressing undernutrition among the vulnerable populations.” At the day-long meeting held virtually, the Ministers of Health signed on a ‘Ministerial Statement of Commitment’ unanimously committing to actualize and intensify essential interventions. The meeting was organized by ministries of health of India, Indonesia, and Nepal and WHO South-East Asia Regional Office. The Ministers committed to multi-sectoral and whole of society approach to end TB with national programs led by the highest possible political level, and closely monitored for targets.  They agreed to increase budgetary and human resource allocations including upfront investments required to catch-up on lost ground during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that US$ 3 billion may be needed annually to implement comprehensive set of interventions required to end TB in the Region.The Ministerial statement called for ensuring the highest attainable standards of rights-based, stigma-free, quality-assured and people-centric services. It emphasized that preventive, diagnostic, treatment, rehabilitative and palliative care, should be accessible to all including migrants, prisoners, children, the aged and other high-risk populations such as people with TB/HIV co-infections.The statement called for increasing outreach of care by strengthening services at all possible health centers and use of innovative care and delivery approaches such as digital health and efficient use of technology to reach the unreached.The Ministers of Health committed to mainstream social and financial protection along with TB care services. Poverty and undernutrition are among the biggest contributor to TB disease. Systematic provision of socioeconomic support, adapted to country context, to the patient and family are essential and more relevant in the COVID-19 era, the statement said.It called for social support to TB patients and their families from the time of development of symptoms, to diagnosis till the successful treatment completion and in some case beyond treatment to address the sequelae, to achieve the goal of eliminating catastrophic financial losses.The Ministerial statement emphasized on empowerment and engagement of community and civil society representatives in planning, monitoring, organizing and providing for such support to ensure a people-centered response.The Regional Director said, “While we continue to work together to mobilize political and financial commitment, we will also continue to provide rapid and relevant guidance and technical assistance to all countries in the Region.”“Together, let us renew and reinvigorate our commitment to End TB, for a fairer, healthier, more health-secure and sustainable Region and world for all,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said.Representatives of partner agencies – Global Fund, Stop TB Partnership, JICA, ADB, World Bank, US Embassy, among others, participated in the meeting.TB and WHO South-East Asia Region –Despite being a preventable and curable disease, TB is the world’s top infectious killer.The WHO South-East Asia Region, home to a quarter of the world's population, bears 43% of the global TB burden and one third of the global burden of drug resistant TB.Hence, in 2017 Regional Director Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh  announced ‘Accelerated efforts to end TB’ as a regional flagship. At a high-level meeting, Ministers of Health and WHO adopted a ‘Call to Action’ committing to more resources and action to end the disease.In 2018, the Region renewed its commitment to further intensify efforts and ensure rapid and concrete progress to end TB by 2030.With concerted efforts and highest-level commitment, progress was being made to trace and treat the affected to curtail the TB epidemic. Notification of TB cases increased to ~3.6 million cases in 2019 from ~2.6 million cases in 2015. As a result, the total treatment coverage increased by about 30%.  The treatment success rate among new drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) patients increased from 79% among the 2014 cohort to 84% for the 2018 cohort.  Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand were on track to achieve the 2020 End TB milestones for reduction in mortality while Myanmar was also on track to reach the milestone for reduction in incidence rate.However, the pandemic reversed the progress by disrupting access to health services and exacerbating social factors like poverty and undernutrition. Over 4.3 million TB cases are estimated to have emerged in 2020 with the region accounting for 43% of all new TB cases globally."
"Health Ministers from WHO South-East Asia Region to discuss pandemic, rebuilding essential health services for UHC",2021-09-03,"SEAR/PR/1760New Delhi/Kathmandu:  The ongoing pandemic and measures to ‘build back better’ essential health services to achieve universal health coverage are among the key issues that health ministers of Member countries of WHO South-East Asia Region will deliberate upon next week.The Seventy Fourth Regional Committee Session of WHO South-East Asia, the annual governing body meeting of WHO in the Region, is being hosted by Nepal from 6 to 10 September.The meeting will be attended by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Regional Director Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Health Ministers and senior health officials of Member countries of the Region, UN Agencies, partners, donors, and civil society representatives.Strengthening public health emergency preparedness and response, accelerating progress for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, and ending viral hepatitis, HIV and STI are among other key issues to be discussed at the annual meeting which is being held virtually for the second consecutive year in view of the pandemic.Monitoring progress on universal health coverage, revitalizing school-health, and the regional framework for vaccine action plan for vaccine preventable diseases would also be discussed.The meeting will also take stock of the progress being made in the Region on resolutions adopted at previous Regional Committee meetings. Measles and rubella elimination by 2023, improving access to essential medical products, the South-East Asia Regional Health Emergency Fund and strengthening health systems to accelerate delivery of services for non-communicable diseases at the primary health care level, would come up at the meeting.While responding to the ongoing pandemic, countries in the Region are also making efforts around the eight regional flagship priorities - to eliminate measles and rubella by 2023, address noncommunicable diseases through multisectoral policies and plans, accelerate reduction of maternal, neonatal and under-five mortality, advance universal health coverage, reverse antimicrobial resistance, scale-up emergency risk management capacities and eliminate neglected tropical diseases and TB.Home to one-fourth of the global population, the Region continues to sustain the impressive progress made around the priority programs. WHO South-East Asia Region eradicated polio in 2014 and eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus in 2016. Maldives and Sri Lanka have eliminated both measles and rubella, while Bhutan, DPR Korea and Timor-Leste have achieved measles elimination. Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand have eliminated lymphatic filariasis. Nepal and Myanmar have eliminated trachoma. India is yaws-free. Sri Lanka and Maldives have eliminated malaria.  Thailand, Sri Lanka and Maldives have eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and Syphilis. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Thailand have controlled Hepatitis B."
Improve COVID-19 immunization coverage of elderly population: WHO,2021-10-01,"SEAR/PR/1767New Delhi | 1 October 2021 - On the International Day of Older Persons, WHO today called for greater efforts in South-East Asia Region to expand COVID-19 vaccination coverage among the older population who remain at highest risk of severe disease and death from the virus. “The older population continues to be highly vulnerable in the ongoing pandemic.  Protecting them against the deadly COVID-19 virus should be our priority. By vaccinating the elderly population as part of high-risk groups, countries can effectively reduce deaths and hospitalization,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region. All countries in the Region have prioritized the elderly populations for COVID-19 vaccination, right from the time they launched the vaccination drive. While a few countries are progressing towards a reasonably good coverage of their elderly population, concerted and focused efforts to improve coverage of the elderly will be required in all countries of the Region to achieve high coverage to protect these vulnerable populations. As countries further accelerate COVID-19 vaccination, they must closely look into all issues impacting access to these lifesaving vaccines for this highest risk population and address them, the Regional Director said.The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severe disease and death. Protecting the most at risk population would not only help in reducing the disease burden, but also limit the impact on the health systems. Throughout the COVID-19 response, we must continue to protect and enhance the health and well-being of older people, including by ensuring they have access to essential health services.On the UN International Day of Older Persons, WHO is also calling on countries and partners to intensify action to foster healthy ageing. All older people must be empowered to fulfil their potential and live with dignity and equality in a healthy environment. It takes a holistic approach to health and well-being for older people, going beyond organ and disease-centric approaches.“Digital equity for all ages” is the theme of this year’s UN International Day of Older Persons, which is especially relevant to policy makers in health and health systems. Key innovations in telemedicine, m-health and e-health initiatives – many catalyzed or expanded by the pandemic - must be accessible to all older people. Such innovations should outlast the pandemic, accelerating Region-wide efforts to achieve universal health coverage.Enhancing health equity -  including equity for all at all ages – continues to be a key focus of the Region.       WHO reiterates its commitment to ensuring all older people can be and do what they value - because health and well-being for all at all ages is essential to leaving no one behind, and achieving a fairer, healthier Region and world for all."
Persistent efforts by countries driving steep decline in tobacco use in South-East Asia Region: WHO,2021-11-17,"SEAR/PR/1772New Delhi - Commending countries in WHO South-East Asia for achieving steep decline in tobacco use, the World Health Organization today said persistent and concerted efforts over the years, and which continue despite the pandemic, must be sustained and scaled up further to rid the Region of the scourge of tobacco.“Sustained political commitment and relentless efforts by countries to strengthen surveillance, expand tobacco control measures including cessation services to help users quit tobacco are some of the key reasons for success,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.As per the WHO Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of Tobacco Use 2000-2025 (4th edition, 2021), WHO South-East Asia Region has achieved the fastest rate of decline in the use of tobacco with average prevalence of smoking among men declining from 50% in 2000 to 25% in 2020 and tobacco smoking among women declining steeply from 8.9% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2020.This progress can be attributed to effective implementation of WHO’s FCTC and MPOWER package, a set of six cost-effective and high impact measures to help countries reduce demand and supply of tobacco, along with best buys to successfully tackle the tobacco epidemic.Tobacco use is one of the key risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and effective tobacco control is important for prevention and control of NCDs - a flagship priority of the Region since 2014.India and Nepal are among the countries likely to achieve 30% relative reduction in tobacco use to meet the target of Global NCD action plan by 2025.If tobacco control efforts continue at the current level, smoking rates in the Region can reach as low as 11% in 2025. This would be the second lowest Regional average rate after Africa - 7.5% in 2025.“The best buys, a set of cost-effective measures to address NCDs, continue to be at the core of the Regional response, recognizing the need for countries to identify & implement the most effective, feasible, and affordable interventions whatever their resource setting,” the Regional Director said, adding that WHO will continue to support Member countries towards tackling NCD’s and controlling tobacco.The Region currently has the highest rates of tobacco use, with around 432 million users, or 29% of its population. It is also home to 266 million smokeless tobacco users out of 355 million globally.Countries in the Region sustained tobacco control measures during the pandemic. WHO supported countries to accelerate and strengthen support for tobacco users to quit during the pandemic with evidence that smokers - current and former - are more likely to suffer severe outcomes of COVID-19.Targeted strategies are needed to address the challenge of smokeless tobacco use, particularly among women. Almost 40% of women tobacco users use only smokeless tobacco.Over the years, countries in the Region have strengthened tobacco control measures.  The Region today has the highest proportion of population covered by tobacco surveillance to monitor tobacco use prevalence and tobacco control policies.  Thailand was the first country in Asia to implement Plain Packaging. Timor-Leste, Nepal, Maldives, India, and Sri Lanka have implemented large-sized graphic health warnings on tobacco packs. Six countries have banned ENDS (electronic cigarettes). Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka are working towards moving tobacco farmers away from growing tobacco. Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste have established and scaled-up tobacco cessation services.There is clear evidence that tobacco control measures work and are highly effective in reducing consumption of tobacco. WHO advocates for all countries to sustain and accelerate implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and MPOWER package.With sustained and accelerated efforts, and using the power of innovation, countries in the Region can fulfil their commitment to FCTC and to the 2030 Sustainable Development agenda, leaving no one behind."
Scale-up routine immunization along with COVID-19 vaccination: WHO,2021-09-08,"SEAR/PR/1763Kathmandu - The World Health
Organization today urged countries in South-East Asia Region to enhance routine
immunization along with the ongoing efforts to rapidly increase COVID-19
vaccination coverage.“The vulnerability to vaccine preventable diseases has increased with the
pandemic disrupting essential immunization services and surveillance for
vaccine preventable disease.  Though efforts are being made, much more
needs to be done specially at the sub-national levels and to reach the
unreached and underserved population,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional
Director, WHO South-East Asia, at the Seventy-Fourth Regional Committee
meeting.Recalling the strong progress made until the onset of the pandemic, the
Regional Director said, by 2019 the Region was in a historically best position
related to vaccine preventable disease control with 91% coverage with three
doses of DTP vaccine (DTP3). Ten of 11 countries had achieved more than 90%
DTP3 coverage.Though routine immunization services were among the first essential services
that countries began to restore during the pandemic, the DTP3 coverage in the
Region dipped to 85% in 2020. The number of unvaccinated or partially
vaccinated children increased to 4.9 million as against 3 million in 2019.
Surveillance of vaccine preventable diseases was also affected.The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted implementation of strategies for
measles and rubella elimination, a flagship priority in the Region.  The
estimated coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in
the Region declined to 88% in 2020 compared with 94% in 2019. Similarly,
coverage with the second dose of measles-containing vaccine declined to 78% in
2020 compared with 83% in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in
surveillance gaps in several countries and has delayed implementation of mass
vaccination campaigns and other immunization-related activities.“There is an urgent need to repair the damage caused by COVID-19, to regain the
momentum achieved in the previous decade, and to protect infants, young people
and adults with life-saving vaccines,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said.The ongoing Regional Committee meeting discussed the Strategic Framework
for the South-East Asia Regional Vaccine Action Plan 2022−2030 which focuses on
the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination and restoration of immunization systems
and vaccine-preventable disease surveillance from the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.We need to ensure strategies are in place to maintain and enhance routine
immunization without impacting the efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination
rates, the Regional Director said.  Adequate human resources for routine
immunization and COVID-19 vaccination, efforts to build confidence among people
to access immunization services and having Standard Operating Procedures in
place for enhancing immunization activities immediately following cessation of
lockdown periods, are some of the critical measures that need to be taken, she
said.“Implementation of the framework will need high-level political and
programmatic commitment and partner collaboration to which WHO is committed,”
the Regional Director said.Countries in the Region are making unprecedented efforts to expand COVID-19
vaccination coverage with over 915 million doses administered across the
Region. The availability of more vaccine doses in recent weeks has helped scale
up coverage.Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Region has maintained its
status of having eradicated polio and eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus.
Measles elimination has been achieved and maintained in five countries, while
two of these countries have also achieved rubella elimination. Four countries
have been verified as having achieved hepatitis B control through immunization.The Regional Committee meeting is the annual governing body meeting of WHO
South-East Asia Region. Being hosted by Nepal, the meeting is being held
virtually for the second consecutive year in view of the pandemic."
Step-up efforts to increase physical activity: WHO,2021-11-25,"SEAR/PR/1773New Delhi -  The World Health Organization has called upon countries in its South-East Asia Region to accelerate action to address insufficient physical activity which is as high as 74% among adolescents, to arrest and reverse the growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases and promote physical and mental well-being. “Physical activity helps prevent non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, which continue to be leading killer diseases in the Region and a risk for severe disease and deaths in the ingoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region. The Regional Director was addressing a virtual meeting of health officials and partners from member countries where the Regional Roadmap for implementation of Global Action Plan for Physical Activity (GAPPA) was launched.  The Regional roadmap aims to facilitate context-specific activities to achieve 10% relative reduction of insufficient physical activity by 2025, and 15% improvement in global levels by 2030.Insufficient physical activity is a leading risk factor for noncommunicable diseases globally and in the South-East Asia Region, where NCDs cause around 8.5 million deaths every year, many of them premature. Globally, 23% adults and 81% adolescents aged 11–17 years do not meet WHO recommendations for physical activity. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, physical inactivity among adults is around 15% and 74% among adolescents.“Countries and communities must take action to provide everyone with more opportunities to be physically active. This requires a collective effort, both national and local, across different sectors and disciplines to implement policies and solutions, appropriate to a country’s cultural and social environment to promote, enable and encourage physical activity,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said.WHO has been advocating physical exercise as one of the primary preventive measure and best buys against NCDs, a flagship priority programme of the Region since 2014.“While there has been progress in terms of commitments, policies and programs for promoting physical activity face many challenges including modern lifestyles, unhealthy work-life balance, lack of enabling and safe environment such as road safety and air pollution,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said.The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the problems with movement restrictions and work from home mandates fueling further the sedentary lifestyles. In addition, mental health issues have increased due to social isolation, fear, and uncertainty.“Physical activity including yoga offer a cost-effective, non-invasive means for better physical, mental health and well-being. Including physical activity into daily lifestyle activities provides multiple health benefits, promotes societal growth, and provides long-term chronic disease prevention and treatment while improving overall global health,” the Regional Director said.Promoting physical activity requires whole of government and whole of society approach including multi-sectoral collaboration – between ministries of health, youth, sports, education, urban planning, city administration, etc. to create an enabling and safe environment for physical activity.Individuals, families, and communities need to incorporate physical activity including yoga or any other exercise in their daily routines, Dr Khetrapal Singh said, adding, “Together, we need to walk the talk”.The two-day regional meeting on physical activity was organized by WHO, the Thai Health Promotion Foundation and International Health Policy Programme."
Strengthen mental health services: WHO,2021-10-09,"SEAR/PR/1768New Delhi - On the World Mental Health Day, the World Health Organization urges countries in South-East Asia Region to make health care for all a reality, by strengthening services to meet the increased needs and fill gaps exacerbated by the pandemic.“Majority of the people living with mental health problems in the low-and middle-income countries do not get adequate treatment. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased our challenges multifold which need to be addressed on a priority,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director WHO South-East Asia Region.Since the beginning of the pandemic last year, while there has been an increase in demand, the critical mental health services have either been disrupted or halted.Bereavement, isolation, loss of income, anxiety and fear have triggered mental health conditions or worsened existing ones. This has increased the risk of severe outcomes for people with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance use disorders.Dr Khetrapal Singh said WHO is assisting Member States to scale up and close gaps in mental health services with interventions to provide comprehensive mental health care especially at the primary health care level.Most of the Member countries currently spend less than 1% of their health budgets on mental health despite evidence of high returns on the investment for care and treatment of mental health disorders, and despite growth in mental health awareness. The WHO South-East Asia Region which is home to one-fourth of the global population, accounts for 39% of the nearly 700,000 suicides that take place globally every year. Suicide is the leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29.WHO is advocating for and supporting countries develop multi-disciplinary suicide prevention program and suicide registries, while supporting research and surveys to strengthen national health information system to collect reliable data on mental health.“Along with treatment gap, we must address workplace stress, help adolescents in schools as also caregivers and families of people living with mental health issues. We need to proactively address stigma and discrimination associated with mental ill health that creates barrier to access care and treatment,” the Regional Director said.    ‘Mental Health in an Unequal World’ is the theme of this year’s World Mental Health Day, observed on 10 October, which is especially relevant to policy makers in health and health systems.Dr Khetrapal Singh said we must look at innovative approaches including remote training of primary health care and community-based workers in basic mental health services.  Universities and health institutions must also make curricula contemporary and relevant to today’s mental health needs and scale up mental health services.WHO reiterates its support to member countries to formulate progressive and equitable mental health policies, laws, program and services, including and prioritizing the most vulnerable sections, to make  “mental health care for all” a reality in the Region, the Regional Director said."
Strengthening health emergency security systems top priority: WHO,2021-09-09,"SEAR/PR/1764Kathmandu - The World Health Organization and Member countries of South-East Asia Region discussed further strengthening health emergency security systems to effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health emergencies.“The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges. No country globally was prepared enough to deal with an emergency of this scale. It is critical that lessons from the ongoing pandemic are used to inform our efforts to strengthen health security systems,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director WHO South-East Asia, at the Seventy-Fourth Regional Committee meeting.Strengthening emergency risk management has been a flagship priority programme of the WHO South-East Asia Region since 2014, which has consistently been scaling up response capacities since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, a mega disaster that hit six countries of the Region.Months before the COVID-19 outbreak, Member countries of the Region had adopted the ‘Delhi Declaration’ to strengthen emergency preparedness capacities by scaling up risk assessment, increasing investments, and enhancing implementation of multi-sectoral plans. Over the years, Member countries made considerable progress in implementing the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) for health emergency preparedness and response.“Countries fully utilized the existing core capacities to control transmission and save lives while trying to match the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic,” the Regional Director said, adding that “critical gaps in our health security systems and arrangements need to be addressed.”The Member countries discussed reviewing and reforming various aspects of preparedness, including but not limited to emergency governance structures and workforce, surveillance and alert mechanisms, laboratory, supply management systems, health-care system preparedness and risk communication and community engagement.The ongoing response has demonstrated that the highest level of political leadership and involvement and functional multisectoral arrangements are crucial in preparing for and responding to severe health emergencies. Such arrangements enable timely, decisive and largescale actions, such as whole-of-government, whole-of-society responses and mobilization of financial resources. These arrangements should be continuously reviewed and strengthened.Another important lesson from the pandemic is the extraordinary scale of surge capacities across the gamut of response from surveillance and contact tracing to clinical management, laboratory testing, vaccination, and community engagement, that the countries need to plan for.  The pandemic has reiterated the importance of effective alert mechanism which ensures early notification and information sharing for global risk assessments and coordinated, timely and decisive responses.Another lesson learnt from the ongoing pandemic is the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical Public Health and Social Measures (PHSM). These measures can stop transmission but also have significant socioeconomic consequences. Hence, epidemiological analysis and response capacity assessment should guide timely adjustment of PHSMs with stringent measures being limited to where and when most needed.Engaging with people for them to take informed decisions to adopt preventive behavior, support surveillance, contact-tracing, quarantine, and sharing correct information, is critical.Dr Khetrapal Singh said Member countries must build, strengthen and maintain core capacities required under IHR (2005) through developing and implementing the national action plans for health security, linked with health systems strengthening efforts.“We must continue to work together to identify priority actions to further strengthen health emergency preparedness and response capacities to respond to the ongoing pandemic and prepare better for future pandemics, emergencies and disasters,” the Regional Director said."
WHO asks countries in South-East Asia Region to be vigilant as cases surge globally and new Variant of Concern is detected,2021-11-27,"SEAR/PR/1774New Delhi, 27 November 2021 –  In view of surge in COVID-19 cases elsewhere globally and detection of new variant of concern Omicron, the World Health Organization today appealed to countries in South-East Asia Region to scale up surveillance, strengthen public health and social measures, and enhance vaccination coverage.“Though COVID-19 cases have been declining in most countries of our Region, the surge in cases elsewhere in the world and confirmation of a new Variant of Concern, is a reminder of the persisting risk and the need for us to continue to do our best to protect against the virus and prevent its spread. At no cost should we let our guards down,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.Countries must enhance surveillance and sequencing. They should assess the risk of importation through international travel based on updated information on circulating variants and response capacities, and take measures accordingly.“Comprehensive and tailored public health and social measures to prevent transmission must continue. The earlier the protective measures are implemented, the less restrictive they would need to be in order to be effective. The more COVID-19 circulates, the more opportunities the virus will have to change and mutate, and the pandemic will last longer,” the Regional Director said.The most important thing people must do is reduce their risk of exposure to the virus – wear a mask and wear it properly covering nose and mouth;  keep distance; avoid poorly ventilated or crowded spaces; keep  hands clean; cover cough and sneeze; and get vaccinated. “As of today 31% of the Region’s population is fully vaccinated, 21% partially vaccinated while nearly 48%, or about a billion people are yet to receive even a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine,” she said, adding that they continue to be at risk of contracting severe disease due to the virus and spreading it further.Even after getting vaccinated, everyone must continue to take precautions to prevent becoming infected and to infect someone else who may get severely affected by the virus. WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution met yesterday and designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern and named it Omicron. Researchers are working to understand how transmissible or virulent this variant is, and how it will impact diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.  “We must not forget that the pandemic is far from over. As societies open up, we should not get complacent. Festivities and celebrations must include all precautionary measures. Crowds and large gatherings must be avoided. The current situation warrants further stepping up efforts on all fronts,” the Regional Director said.

WHO South-East Asia countries resolve to reorient and strengthen health systems,2021-09-07,"SEAR/PR/1762Kathmandu - Taking lessons from the
ongoing pandemic and emphasizing a once-in-a-century opportunity, countries of
WHO South-East Asia Region today adopted a Ministerial Declaration resolving to
strengthen health system resilience to ensure health security, and achieve
universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals for health.“Strong health systems that are primary health care-oriented, and which leave
no one behind, create populations that are healthier, more productive and
financially secure. Resilient health systems are the bedrock of emergency
preparedness and response, and ensure that when acute events occur, essential
health services can be maintained,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional
Director, WHO South-East Asia, at a ministerial round table during the ongoing
Seventy-Fourth Regional Committee meeting.Through the Declaration adopted at the ministerial round table, Member countries
committed to provide political leadership and accountability to advance health
security and progress towards universal health coverage and the health-related
SDGs.The Member countries resolved to reorient health systems towards comprehensive
primary health care through increased public investments, as the foundation for
strengthening both public health emergency capabilities and achievement of
universal health coverage.“The pandemic has highlighted the urgency and importance of investment in human
resource for health, especially at the primary health care level, and the need
for adequate supply of affordable, effective, quality and safe medical products
to ensure an effective response to public health emergencies and to build
resilient health systems,” the Regional Director said.The Declaration also commits to closer engagement with and the empowerment of
communities to maintain the delivery of essential health services and public
health programmes during and after the pandemic.To roll-out effective response for at-risk and affected communities, Member
countries agreed to ensure integration of public health emergencies and
disaster risk management strategies, as well as strengthening surveillance and
preparedness capacity at the primary health care level.Member countries additionally resolved to accelerate integration of
noncommunicable diseases including mental health, and other programmes, at
the primary health care level, as well as establishing national quality
standards for primary health care services and ensuring access to quality
health services during the pandemic and recovery phase.The Member countries further agreed to appropriately leverage the potential of
traditional systems of medicine, while optimizing innovations in digital health
technologies.The declaration emphasized the importance of leveraging additional resources
and partnerships, including the important role of WHO, to support the
development of national capacities to address public health emergencies and
ensure the delivery of high-quality health services for all.“Together we are stronger. Together we can build back better essential health
services, for a fairer, healthier and more health-secure future for all,
leaving no one behind,” the Regional Director said."
WHO South-East Asia Regional Committee meeting begins,2021-09-06,"SEAR/PR/1761Kathmandu: The Seventy Fourth Regional Committee meeting of WHO South-East Asia Region, began today with health leaders calling for greater commitment to build resilient health systems and to achieve universal health coverage.“This Session is convened to take important decisions on improving the health status of the people in this Region at a time our health systems are overstretched to cater essential health services to the needy people. Let’s ensure equitable access to vaccines, medicines, tools and technologies for the sake of humanity. Reaching out to the unreached should be our priority,” said the Prime Minister of Nepal, Mr Sher Bahadur Deuba, while inaugurating the annual governing body meeting of WHO in the Region.The WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, “the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a heavy toll on lives, livelihoods, societies and economies. I am pleased to see a decline in cases and deaths in the South-East Asia region, following the devastating surge in May of this year.  However, the situation varies widely from country to country and place to place, with steep increases and overwhelmed hospitals in some areas…….We must never again allow a pandemic on this scale. And that we must never again allow an injustice on this scale.”Regional Director Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh said, “covid has taken a massive toll on our health systems. Services have been disrupted and health care workers exhausted. Our challenge is multi-faceted, we have to regain lost ground in terms of health outcomes, rebuild health systems that have lost capacity and we have to do this at a time when government revenues in all countries will be under intense pressure.” The five-day virtual session, attended by Health Ministers and senior health officials of the Member countries of the Region, UN Agencies, partners, donors, and civil society representatives, will deliberate on strengthening public health emergency preparedness and response and accelerating progress for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, among others health issues.A ministerial roundtable is planned tomorrow on ‘building back better’ the essential health services, hit by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim to achieve universal health coverage. Other key issues to be discussed are regional framework for vaccine action plan, revitalizing school-health, and ending viral hepatitis, HIV and STIs.Progress made by the Region on previous Regional Committee resolutions on measles and rubella elimination by 2023, improving access to essential medical products, and strengthening health systems to accelerate delivery of services for non-communicable diseases at the primary health care level, will also be discussed at the session. Home to one-fourth of the global population but with a disproportionate burden of diseases, the Region has been prioritizing elimination of measles and rubella by 2023, addressing noncommunicable diseases through multisectoral policies and plans, accelerating reduction of maternal, neonatal and under-five mortality, advancing universal health coverage, reversing antimicrobial resistance, scaling-up emergency risk management capacities, eliminating neglected tropical diseases and ending TB."
World AIDS Day,2021-12-01,"By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia On World AIDS Day, the WHO South-East Asia Region joins global calls to End inequalities and End AIDS – the theme of this year’s commemoration. HIV continues to be a major global health issue, having claimed 36.3 million lives globally so far. In 2020, around 680 000 people died from HIV-related causes and 1.5 million people acquired HIV globally. An estimated 38 million people were living with HIV infection. The South-East Asia Region is home to around 10% of all people living with HIV globally, and accounts for 12% of global AIDS-related mortality. Amid the COVID-19 response, the Region continues to take targeted action to maintain essential health services, including to prevent, detect and treat HIV. Today, as we show solidarity with people living with HIV, remember those who have died from AIDS-related illnesses, and express gratitude to those who are working to end AIDS, WHO urges all countries of the Region to intensify action to close remaining gaps, achieve the 95-95-95 targets, and end the inequalities, stigma and discrimination that keep the epidemic alive.The Region has in recent years achieved significant progress against HIV, with all countries committed to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3 – by 2030, end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat. Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand have achieved the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. Between 2010 and 2020, the Region reduced annual new HIV infections by 46% and AIDS-related deaths by 64%. An estimated 61% of people living with HIV in the Region are now receiving life-long antiretroviral therapy. However, these and other successes are not uniform across countries and populations. Marginalized populations in particular continue to be underserved. Ending AIDS and associated inequalities – social, cultural and legal – requires high-level political commitment. In 2020, at a WHO-supported high-level meeting of ministers of health from across the Region, countries reiterated their commitment to achieve global and Regional targets and intensify efforts in this Decade of Action to end viral hepatitis, HIV and STIs as public health threats.  To achieve our time-bound targets and goals, several priorities must be addressed. First, recovering lost ground. Despite the Region’s best efforts, COVID-19-related disruptions have impacted access to HIV prevention and testing, whereas access to treatment has for the most part been maintained. To catch up on pre-pandemic progress, key populations must be reached, including through institutionalized community engagement initiatives. Measures to anticipate and mitigate further disruptions must be integrated into emergency preparedness and response plans, not only for pandemics such as COVID-19, but all other hazards. Second, securing sufficient and sustained domestic investments in HIV services, which must be accessible at the primary health care level. Such investments will not only increase equitable access to quality HIV services, but also strengthen health system resilience, complementing Region-wide efforts to build strong PHC-oriented health systems, as emphasized in a landmark resolution adopted at the Seventy-fourth session of the WHO Regional Committee in September 2021.  Third, leveraging high-impact innovations. In pilot studies conducted in several of the Region’s countries, newer tools such as HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis have proven immensely valuable. To achieve maximum impact, these and other innovations must be incorporated into comprehensive service packages and rolled out at population level. Fourth, intensifying action to address the epidemic’s non-biomedical aspects, including legal and policy domains. In our Region and across the world, stigma, discrimination and other structural determinants and inequalities continue to impede progress, deepening health and social inequities, and obstructing sustainable social and economic development.Action is needed, and now. To facilitate progress in this Decade of Action, the Region will soon launch a new integrated Regional Action Plan for viral hepatitis, HIV and STIs (2022–2026), which will be aligned with forthcoming global health sector strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, as well as the SDGs. The Plan will be accompanied by a Regional accountability framework, which will track WHO and country actions to achieve the 2025 interim targets and the 2030 goals, and will prioritize efforts to enhance community ownership, action and engagement. Together, we can and must succeed. On World AIDS Day, WHO reiterates its commitment to support all countries of the Region to end inequalities and end AIDS, leaving no one behind."
World Antimicrobial Awareness Week,2021-11-18,"By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia  To mark this year’s World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW), WHO is calling on countries in the South-East Asia Region and across the world to intensify whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to prevent and combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), one of the Region’s eight Flagship Priorities. Globally, AMR is responsible for around 700 000 deaths annually and impacts progress towards at least four of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including good health and well-being, reduced inequality, clean water and sanitation, and no poverty. According to World Bank estimates, by 2050, unless urgent action is taken, AMR is expected to cause at least 10 million deaths annually and cause a 3.8 percent reduction in annual gross domestic product (GDP). AMR could force 24 million more people to extreme poverty by 2030. The world’s poorest people –those living in low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately vulnerable. The message of this year’s WAAW – “Spread Awareness, Stop Resistance” – could not be more urgent.All countries of the Region continue to take targeted action to prevent and combat AMR, in line with the Region’s Flagship Priority, the Global Action Plan on AMR, and the health-related SDGs.All Member States are implementing national action plans to address AMR, and most have established a national multisectoral committee on AMR, in addition to a multisectoral AMR working group.Amid the COVID-19 response, the Region has achieved full participation in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, and remains the only WHO Region in which all countries carry out the annual Tripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey.  Increasing multisectoral awareness and action is critical to prioritizing action at the human-animal-environment interface – what is known as the “One Health” approach. The Global Tripartite between WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), joined more recently by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is responsible for promoting, coordinating and facilitating One Health activities across the world, based on the Global Framework for Development & Stewardship to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance Roadmap. In all countries of the Region, commitment to strengthen implementation of One Health activities continues to grow, reflected most recently in September 2021, at a bi-regional meeting on increasing responsible and prudent use of antimicrobial agents in agriculture, and in July 2021, at a meeting of the Technical Advisory Group on the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies.To sustain and accelerate momentum, several priorities must be addressed. First, strengthening awareness among general public and other stakeholders such as those working on human, animal, plant and environmental health promoting rational use of antibiotics and discouraging irrational self-medication which is seen more so during COVID-19 pandemic Community-based initiatives targeting households, workplaces etc. must promote awareness and responsible action on how to prevent AMR. Similarly, capacity-strengthening initiatives for healthcare workers must continue to emphasize the judicious use of medicines and Infection Prevention and Control. Second, AMR cannot be addressed by one or two sectors working in isolation. National committees, task forces and working groups must have in place clear annual plans and coordination mechanisms with specific roles and responsibilities. Third, amid intense fiscal pressures, increased domestic allocations are required.. Fourth,  use of data, coupled with Operational Research on specific aspects of AMR in country contexts, must guide programmatic adaptations.So much is at stake. AMR threatens to send us back to a time when we could not easily treat common infections. It is already making health care more costly, less efficient, causing avoidable morbidity and mortality, and exacerbating health, social and economic inequities. Throughout the COVID-19 response, all countries of the Region must continue to prevent and combat AMR, and accelerate progress towards our Flagship Priorities and the health-related SDGs. As we commence this seventh World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, WHO re-affirms its commitment to support all countries of the Region to spread awareness, stop resistance."
World Patient Safety Day,2021-09-17,"By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia The WHO South-East Asia Region continues to accelerate action to enhance patient safety and ensure access for all to safe maternal and newborn care – the theme of this year’s World Patient Safety Day. Globally, every year, an estimated 134 million adverse events due to unsafe care occur in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries, contributing to around 2.6 million deaths. Approximately 810 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, in addition to around 6700 newborns. An estimated 2 million stillbirths occur annually, over 40% of them during labour. In the Region and across the world, most stillbirths and maternal and newborn deaths could be avoided through the provision of safe and quality care by skilled health professionals working in supportive environments. The Region has in recent years applied targeted action to enhance patient safety, in line with its Flagship Priority on achieving universal health coverage (UHC) and the Region’s Strategy for Patient Safety 2016–2025, in addition to the recently adopted Global Patient Safety Action Plan 2021–2030. Most countries of the Region continue to implement a national patient safety or quality strategy. Several countries have in place administrative structures tasked with ensuring health-care quality and safety. Policy makers, programme managers and facility administrators in all countries of the Region continue to incorporate patient safety into disease-specific and clinical programme areas, including to accelerate reductions in maternal, newborn and child mortality – another of the Region’s Flagship Priorities. Four countries of the Region have achieved the 2030 neonatal mortality rate target of 12 per 1000 live births or lower. Six countries have achieved the 2030 stillbirth rate target of 12 per 1000 total births. Two are on track to achieve the 2030 maternal mortality rate target. Amid the COVID-19 response, WHO continues to support Member States of the Region to maintain and strengthen essential health services, including for maternal and newborn care. In the Region and globally, the pandemic has exposed gaps in patient and health worker safety, highlighting the need for policy makers and facility administrators to strengthen best practices at the point of care to prevent avoidable risks, improve the quality and safety of frontline services, and enhance resource utilization. Adequate infection prevention and control, access to hand hygiene facilities, adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, strong antimicrobial stewardship, health workers who are trained in and observe safety protocol – these and other interventions are required to increase patient safety and accelerate progress towards full implementation of the Regional and global strategies.  On maternal and newborn care specifically, WHO is calling on stakeholders to increase uptake of evidence-based interventions with point of care quality improvements, particularly during childbirth, with a focus on several priorities. First, fostering respectful care for safe delivery. Every woman has the right to a positive birth experience and to be treated with dignity and respect by facility staff regardless of background, health, or social status. Second, ensuring appropriate use of drugs and medical products during childbirth, including blood and injection safety. In all countries of the Region, WHO guidance on intrapartum care, essential newborn care, advanced newborn care, and emergency obstetric and newborn care must be harnessed and applied to maximum effect. Third, continued commitment to improve quality of care, including through the Region’s Point of Care Quality Improvement Model. All adverse events must be reported, and corrective measures applied. Fourth, ensuring health workers are well trained and well equipped to provide safe care, for which knowledge-sharing and collaboration are essential, with a focus on strengthening the midwifery cadre and enhancing access to quality emergency obstetric services. Not a second can be spared. In all countries of the Region, the COVID-19 crisis has increased fiscal challenges, underscoring the need to obtain maximum health system efficiency with allocated funds. On medication errors alone, the world loses an estimated US$ 42 billion annually, excluding lost wages, productivity, or health care costs. In low- and middle-income countries, unsafe and poor-quality care leads to a US$ 1.4 trillion to 1.6 trillion loss in productivity every year. Inaction is neither affordable nor sustainable. On World Patient Safety Day, WHO reiterates its commitment to support all countries of the Region to eliminate avoidable harm in health care, to strengthen health service delivery, and to achieve universal health coverage – because all people have a right to safe, dignified and respectful care."
World Sight Day,2021-10-14,"By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia  On
World Sight Day, WHO is calling on countries in the South-East Asia Region and
across the world to ensure access for all to quality eye care services.
Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment. At least 1
billion people have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or is
yet to be addressed. Vision impairment affects people of all ages, but
especially those over the age of 50. Despite comprising around a quarter
of the world’s population, the Region accounts for 30% of global blindness and
32% of visual impairment. Ageing populations and increased prevalence of
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes could exacerbate eye health
issues in the years to come. To avoid that outcome, WHO continues to support
all countries of the Region to achieve access for all to quality eye care
services, and to advocate for society-wide buy-in to the “4 Ps” of life-long
eye health – Prevent, Protect, Preserve and Prioritize.The Region has in recent years accelerated action to strengthen the quality and
reach of eye care services, in line with its Flagship Priorities on achieving
universal health coverage (UHC), preventing and controlling NCDs, and
eliminating neglected tropical diseases and other diseases on the verge of
elimination. In 2018 Nepal eliminated trachoma, followed by Myanmar in 2020.
Bhutan has achieved eye care coverage of 99.7% and eye care coverage among
school children is 99.5%. Eyeglasses are provided free of charge to all who
need them. Four countries of the Region – Bhutan, India, Maldives and Thailand
– have piloted WHO’s Revised Eye Care Service Assessment Tool, which focuses on
integrating eye care programmes into services at the primary, secondary and
tertiary levels. New WHO guidance on strengthening diagnosis and treatment of
diabetic retinopathy continues to be rolled out, alongside Region-wide efforts
to increase access to assistive technology. In November 2021, a three-day
ministerial meeting will be held to strengthen high-level buy-in to achieve
access for all to quality eye care services, with a focus on leaving no one
behind.  In all countries of the Region, accelerated action is needed, and now. In May
2021, at the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, Member States adopted two
new global targets for eye care by 2030: first, a 40% increase in effective
coverage of refractive errors; and second, a 30% increase in effective coverage
of cataract surgery. The targets are intended not only to increase global eye
care coverage, but also to strengthen the quality of the eye care services
delivered. Importantly, the targets are aligned with and reflect the global and
regional pursuit of UHC and the need to integrate eye care programmes with
existing services, especially at the primary level. Cataract surgery coverage
is a strong indicator of eye care service provision. At present, it shows
marked variation by income. By strengthening eye care services at the primary
level, all countries of the Region can preserve or bring sight to millions of
people, achieving rapid and sustained progress towards our Flagship Priorities
and the 2030 targets.We can all take action. Many eye diseases can be prevented by eating a healthy
and balanced diet, and by partaking in regular and adequate physical activity.
These and other healthy habits help maintain a healthy weight, control obesity,
and prevent diabetes, all of which can impact eye health. It is equally
important to protect eyes from workplace accidents, severe sunlight, harmful
radiation and prolonged exposure to screens. For every 20 minutes of screen
time, look at something 20 or more feet away for 20 seconds. Regular and
comprehensive eye examinations carried out at recommended intervals are
essential for eyesight preservation. Maintaining eye health is a key part of healthy
ageing, ensuring all older people can be and do what they value. Together, we
must prioritize eye health at all stages of life, not only for ourselves, but
for our family and friends, and the wider community.The Region must sustain and accelerate momentum. Vision impairment and
blindness can have major and long-lasting effects on all aspects of life,
including school and work opportunities, and the ability to access public
services. They compromise social and economic development and impact the life-outcomes
of hundreds of millions of people in the Region, and billions of people
globally. Amid the COVID-19 response, countries of the Region are committed to
achieving a social and economic recovery that is fairer, healthier, more
resilient and sustainable, towards which increased access to quality eye care
services will contribute. On World Sight Day, WHO reiterates its commitment to
support all countries of the Region to achieve access for all to quality eye
care services – a vision that is our duty to achieve."
World Stroke Day,2021-10-28,"By Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia  The
WHO South-East Asia Region is committed to strengthening health care services
to prevent, treat and manage stroke, and to provide quality rehabilitative care
for stroke-related disability. Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of
death and the third leading cause of disability. One in four people are in
danger of stroke in their lifetime. Lifestyle risk factors for stroke include
being overweight or obese, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol abuse.
Medical risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes
and a personal or family history of stroke or heart attack. An estimated 70% of
strokes occur in low- and middle-income countries, which also account for 87%
of stroke-related deaths and disability-adjusted life years. To help address
this inequity, WHO continues to support all countries of the Region to identify
and apply “best buy” interventions that reduce the risk of stroke, and which
strengthen access for all to quality stroke services.The Region has in recent years achieved significant progress on its Flagship
Priorities on preventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and
achieving universal health coverage, both of which are critical to Region-wide
efforts to prevent, treat and manage stroke, and to increase access to
rehabilitative care. All countries of the Region continue to implement
multi-sectoral NCD action plans, while also expanding the provision of NCD
services at the primary level, in line with the 2016 Colombo Declaration.
Several countries continue to lead globally on tobacco control efforts, with
India, Nepal, Maldives Thailand and Timor-Leste among the world’s top 10
countries with the largest graphic warnings on tobacco packaging. Amid the
pandemic response, the Region continues to promote healthy lifestyles,
including by facilitating physical activity and healthy eating, and by tackling
harmful use of alcohol and substance abuse. Increased taxation of unhealthy
products will not only change unhealthy behaviours, but could also enhance budgetary
allocations on health, including on services to prevent, detect, treat and
manage stroke and other NCDs.    By the end of this year, the Region will have completed the second year of its
multi-country support for stroke care improvement initiative. The programme
aims to support countries to strengthen stroke management and referrals through
the development and training of multidisciplinary teams consisting of doctors,
nurses and rehabilitation therapists. During the first year of implementation,
which started in April 2021, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar and Timor-Leste
participated in the care improvement programme, which has since been expanded
to Nepal and Sri Lanka. In all countries of the Region, several interventions can be applied to achieve
immediate progress in strengthening stroke care services. First, integrating
stroke prevention and detection into preventive and promotive health
interventions, especially at the primary level. Community intervention,
e-health and appropriate medication and lifestyle modification can prevent at
least 50% of stroke events. Alongside increased public literacy in the FAST
method (Facial
drooping, Arm
weakness, Speech
difficulty and Timely
emergency service) they can significantly reduce the incidence and impact of
stroke. Second, strengthening existing pathways of care from the primary level
up, and through to rehabilitation, ensuring that gaps are identified and
addressed using a hub and spoke model. Specific focus is needed to improve
fast-track referrals and enhance emergency stroke services. Third, making
essential stroke medicines accessible to all. Thrombolytic medicines and other
medicines for stroke are now included in WHO’s Essential Medicines List and
should be integrated into national lists. Fourth, identifying and implementing
high-impact innovations. Virtual capacity building in particular holds great
promise, alongside tele-networking within and between countries to improve
skills and share knowledge and resources. Every opportunity must be grasped. Stroke is a leading source of disability and
a major contributor to lost disability-adjusted life years, especially in low-
and middle-income countries. It is a needless impediment to sustainable social
and economic growth. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 response, countries of the
Region must leverage every chance possible to improve health and well-being,
increase health system efficiency, and promote social and economic empowerment
and growth. On World Stroke Day, WHO reiterates its commitment to support countries
of the Region to strengthen stroke care services to reduce incidence, enhance
detection, improve treatment, and increase access to quality rehabilitative
services. A fairer, healthier more sustainable Region is ours to achieve."
