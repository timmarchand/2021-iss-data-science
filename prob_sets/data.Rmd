# Big-picture

## Research question

*What is your research question?*

## Description of data

*Please give a very short description of the data set along with it's original source.*

## Load data into R

*Include the code to load your data here. If your data is not confidential nor is it private in nature, consider publishing it as a `.csv` file on Google Sheets as in the code chunk below; instructions on how to do this are in Steps 1-6 [here](https://twitter.com/rudeboybert/status/1055821846539591680), or simply use the customised read_gdoc_csv() function.*

```{r, message=FALSE}

```

## Clean variable names

*Piping your data frame into the `clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package will clean your variable names, making them easier to work with.*

```{r}

```

## Explore your data

*Be sure to explore your data. Note that `eval=FALSE` is set so that R Markdown doesn't "evaluate" this code chunk, i.e. it will ignore it in the ultimate `.html` report. You should run this code on your own, but not in the ultimate `.html` report.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
glimpse()
```
*Write any observations about your exploration here.*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Variables

## Identification variable

*What is your identification (ID) variable (if you have one)?*

## Outcome variable

*What is your outcome variable* $y$? What are its units of measurement?

## Numerical explantory variable

*What is your numeric explanatory variable? What are its units of measurement?*

## Categorical explantory variable

*What is your categorical explanatory variable? Does it have between 3 and 5 levels. Please list the different levels.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Rows/observations

## Observational units

*What is the observational unit of your data? In other words, what does each row in your data represent?*

## Sample size

*How many rows/cases are in the data i.e. what is the sample size? Is the sample size at least 50?*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Preview of data

## Pare down variables

*`select()` the following variables **in this order** and drop all others. Eliminating all unnecessary variables will making visually exploring the raw values less taxing mentally, as we'll have less data to look at.*

1.  *The identification variable*
2.  *The outcome variable* $y$
3.  *The numerical explanatory variable*
4.  *The categorical explanatory variable*
5.  *Optional: any other variable you find interesting*

```{r}

```

## Preview data

*Display a random sample of 5 rows of your data frame by piping it into the `sample_n(5)` function from the `dplyr` package . You'll get the same 5 rows everytime you knit this document and hence replicable results because we set the seed value of the random number generator in the first code chunk above.*

```{r}

```


# Exploratory data analysis

_Let's do an little exploratory data analysis._

## Inspect for missing values

_Address missing values._

Using the trick in the "Become an R Data Ninja!" file, we get a sense of how many missing values we have in our data. 

```{r}
colSums(is.na(ma_schools))
```

Missing values details...

```{r}

```

## Summary statistics

_Compute some quick summary statistics of the outcome variable and comment._

```{r}

```

Summary statistics details...

## Histogram of outcome variable 

_Visualize the distribution of the outcome variable using a histogram and comment._

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Detialed title", fig.align = "center", fig.width=16/2, fig.height=9/2}
ggplot() 
```

These data seem roughly bell-shaped, with no obvious skew. There is an outlier average Math SAT score of around 750 or so. This school is the [MA Academy for Math and Science School](https://www.massacademy.org/).


## Scatterplot 

_Visualize the relationship of the outcome variable and the numerical explanatory variable using a scatterplot and comment._

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Detialed title", fig.align = "center", fig.width=16/2, fig.height=9/2}

ggplot()
```

Some visualization details...


## Boxplot

_Visualize the relationship of the outcome variable and the categorical explanatory variable using a scatterplot and comment._

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Detialed title", fig.align = "center", fig.width=16/2, fig.height=9/2}
ggplot()
```

Some visualization details...


## Colored scatterplot

_Visualize the relationship of the outcome variable and both explanatory variables using a colored scatterplot and comment._

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Detialed title", fig.align = "center", fig.width=16/2, fig.height=9/2}
ggplot()
```

# 3. Multiple linear regression

## 3.1 Methods

The components of our multiple linear regression model are the following:

* Outcome variable $y$ =
* Numerical explanatory variable $x_1$ = 
* Categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ = 


## 3.2 Model Results

Table 2. Regresstion table of...
 
```{r}

## 3.3 Interpreting the regression table

The regression equation for ... is the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}\widehat {score} =& b_{0} + b_{prct} \cdot prct + b_{med} \cdot 1_{is\ med}(x_2) + b_{large} \cdot 1_{is\ large}(x_2) \\
 =& 588.190 - 2.777 \cdot prct - 11.913 \cdot 1_{is\ med}(x_2) - 6.362 \cdot 1_{is\ large}(x_2)
\end{aligned} 
$$

* The intercept ($b_0$ = 588.190) represents .... (Table 2).
* The estimate for the slope  ($b_{prct}$ = -2.777) is the .... Based on this estimate, for every .., there was an associted increase/decrease in ...
* The estimate for ... ($b_{med}$ = -11.913) and ... ($b_{large}$ = -6.36) are the offsets in intercept relative to the baseline group'sã€€... (Table 2). In other words, on average ...

Thus the three regression lines have equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Small schools (in red)}: \widehat {score} =& 588.190 - 2.777 \cdot prct\\
\text{Medium schools (in green)}: \widehat {score} =& 576.277 - 2.777 \cdot prct\\
\text{Large schools (in blue)}: \widehat {score} =& 581.828 - 2.777 \cdot prct
\end{aligned} 
$$
