## Update data and figures folders

source("r_docs/update_folder.R")

## select the week you want to download the data for, and the type of data:
## "figs" for figures and images
## "r_docs" for R scripts and R Markdown
## "data" for csv and other data files
## "PS" for problem sets

## leave blank to download all available (this will take longer)


## e.g. update_folder(week = 2) --> for all types from week 2; 
## e.g. update_folder(week = 1:3, "r_docs") --> for first 3 weeks r_docs only
## e.g. update_folder() --> all available types for all available weeks
