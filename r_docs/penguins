### Learn more about penguins!


## From the variable associations code
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggpubr, vcd, broom, moderndive, sjPlot, gapminder)


### Because you need more penguins in your life
pacman::p_load(palmerpenguins)

library(palmerpenguins)

### Use glimpse() to find out about the dataset
### Use summary() to get the statistical summary
### Which variables are categorical? Which ones are continuous?

## Plotting 

### univariate data (one variable)
### Categorical counts (bar or column charts -  - which ggplot2 geom should you use?)
### Continuous distributions (histograms, density plots - which ggplot2 geom should you use?)

### bivariate (two variables)
###continuous vs continuous (scatter plots - which ggplot2 geom should you use?)
### categorical vs continuous (box-plots or faceted histograms)
### categorical vs categorical (mosaic plots)

### How can you plot trivariate data?


## Statistical tests

### Correlations - which type of bivariates can you test?
### Chi-square test - which type of bivariates can you test?


## Modelling

### Linear models for a selection of variables

### Any surprising results??
