## Introduction

This is an example of the web scraping process in action. The data involved is from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel-well_stowaway), and the subject matter is a sensitive one: **Wheel-well stowaways**. 

These are people who attempt to travel in the landing gear compartment of an aircraft, usually in a desperate attempt to escape poverty or some other difficult circumstance. Unfortunately, many of these attempts end in tragedy. In fact, we are going to try and find out what proportion and where the most deadly routes are.

Even though this example should demonstrate the usefulness of web-scraping, it is worth remembering and be resepctful of the fact that there are hundreds of sad stories that lie behind the data.

## Getting the table data

As we have seen before, we know that it is okay to scrape wikipedia, so we don't need to check permissions. Instead, let's save the webpage's url, and grab all the `html` data.

![](../figures/html_to_nodes.png)

```{r check table nodes}
url  <-  'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel-well_stowaway'

 read_html(url) %>% 
 html_nodes('table')

```

From the immediate output, we can see that there were 5 tables on the page, but that probably the one we want is the first one, which is a `wikitable sortable` type.

Let's select that, and do a quick tidy up with `janitor::clean_name()`:

![](../figures/html_to_table.png)

```{r grab first table}

 stowaway <- read_html(url) %>% 
 html_nodes('table') %>%
    html_table( fill = TRUE)  %>%
  .[[1]] %>%   # this is the same as purrr::pluck(1)
  tibble() %>%  # to use with dplyr 
  clean_names() %>% # for better column names
  rename (case = stowaway_s) # change to case


```


It looks like we have grabbed the details of the table okay, so now we can stop to think what do we actually want to find out. Looking at the information in the table, there are several questions we can answer pretty quickly:

1. From the date column we can ask: When did the stowaways make their attempts? (How are the incidents distributed over time?)

1. From the flight column: What are the most common routes?

1. Which aircraft are most often targetted by stowaways?

The last 2 questions can be answered quite quickly with a bit of `dplyr` wrangling. The first one requires an extra step as the date column is currently a columns of character values (strings).

## Dealing with dates

Let's check out the `date` column first though.

![](../figures/table_to_date.png)

Lubridate have a lot of really useful functions for automatically parsing character strings into correct date format. First, let's use the function`mdy`.
Then we'll grab the year and month for each date.

```{r}
stowaway %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date))
```


>
>What do you think `mdy` stands for? 
>When would you use the similar `dmy` or `ymd`?
>

Two failed to parse - let's see why by creating a new variable with `mutate()`, and filter for when the new variable has a `NA` value.

```{r get date info}
  stowaway %>% 
  mutate(date2 = mdy(date),
         year = year(date2)) %>%
  filter(is.na(date2))
```

The problem is that for two cases, the date is not fully-formed. We can deal with that with lubridate too: 
```{r}
 stowaway %>% 
  mutate(date2 = mdy(date),
         year = year(date2)) %>%
  filter(is.na(date2)) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date, truncated = 2L))
```

By adding the argument `truncated = 2L`, we tell the function `ymd` to expect only a year value.

Let's plug that in with the original code, nested in an ifelse argument
```{r}
 stowaway <- 
  stowaway %>% 
  mutate(date = 
           case_when(nchar(date) > 4 ~ mdy(date),
                TRUE ~  ymd(date, truncated = 2L))) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))
```


We can now count the years of stowaway incidents, or plot the cases over time with  `ggplot2`.

```{r count years}
stowaway %>% count(year, sort = TRUE)

```

For plotting by year, we need to include all the zero counts as well.
This can be done with `tidyr::expand()`, then rejoin the main dataframe before plotting:

```{r plot year}
stowaway %>% 
  # drop NA values for min() and max() to work
  drop_na() %>% 
  # expand all year values from earliest to latest
expand(year = min(year):max(year)) %>% 
  # rejoin the dataframe (lots of NAs will be produced)
  left_join(stowaway) %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,n)) +
           geom_point() +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,10,2)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1945,2020,5))
```


## Counting things

The last two questions can be instantly answered using the `count()` function. Let's do that now:

```{r counting}
stowaway %>% 
  count(aircraft, sort = TRUE) 

```

For aircraft, it looks like we have some missing values (the empty "" with a count of 16). Let's replace those with NA values (plus any other empty strings in the table). They can be easily filtered out later, if necessary.

```{r filter empty}
## the dplyr way
#stowaway %>% mutate_all(list(~na_if(.,"")))

## Using []

#stowaway[stowaway == ""] <- NA
```

Let's count again, this time plotting the output for the top 10.

```{r count and plot aircraft}
stowaway %>% 
  count(aircraft, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  # very useful code to reorder before plotting - keep a note!
  mutate(aircraft = fct_reorder(aircraft, n)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, aircraft)) +
  geom_col()
```

>
>Now  **copy**, **paste** and **tweak** the above to count routes from the flight column.
>

```{r copy, paste and tweak}
stowaway 
```
<br>
<details>

```{r count and plot flight}
stowaway %>% 
  count(flight, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  # very useful code to reorder before plotting - keep a note!
  mutate(flight = fct_reorder(flight, n)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, flight)) +
  geom_col()
```

</details>
<br>

The results of counting the `aircraft` and `flight` variables were quite revealing, but we can do a bit better by tidying up some of the details. For a start, several of the aircraft had more than one way of being written, and any difference in the text string will be counted differently.

Let's deal with that first.

```{r check distinct aircraft}
stowaway %>% 
  # distinct finds all the unique values of a variable
  distinct(aircraft) %>%  
  arrange(aircraft) %>% 
  # print all the rows, not just first 10
  print(n = Inf)
```


>
>Why did we use arrange() here? Put the answer as a comment above the arrange(aircraft) line of code.
>

The advantage of putting things in alphabetical order is that we can quickly see patterns that might be useful when we try and organise text data. Looking at the `aircraft` values, there are some things to notice:

- there is a general pattern of **Manufacturer** [space] **Model** (`Airbus A330` etc.)

- sometimes the **Model** has extra details which may not be necessary (`Boeing 777-200` etc.)

- sometimes the **Manufacturer** is written after other details (`US Military Boeing C-17` etc.)

When cleaning up text data like this, it's recommended to find a general rule that applies to most cases, then deal with the exceptions.

>
>1. Make a rule for the general
>2. Deal with the exceptions
>

When it comes to the manufacturer of the aircraft, the general rule might be to extract the first word of the string. Let's see what that looks like.

```{r extract first word from aircraft}
stowaway %>% 
  # general rule
  transmute(manufacturer = str_extract(string = aircraft, pattern = "^.+?\\b")) %>% 
  distinct(manufacturer) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)

```

A couple of things to note in the code above. First, I use `transmute()` which does the exact same job as `mutate` except it only keeps the columns named - so in a way it is like `mutate()` and `select()` combined. I've used it because at this stage it is easier to see what is going on without the other columns.

The other important thing to notice is that we have used our first function from the `stringr` package, `str_extract()`. This function can be read a **string extract**, or in the context above **string extract from the string `aircraft` the pattern "^\\b.+?\\b"**. The last part is an example of a **regular expression**, often shortened to **regex**, which is one of the most fundamental ideas behind processing text data on a computer - used by all computer programming languages, and even every time you do a Google search.

We'll discuss the **regex** in much more detail later, but for now it is enough to know that the regex pattern captures the first word in the full text string.

So looking at the results, what are the exceptions?

>
>How many of the rows above are exceptions?
>

Sometimes, this is where knowledge of the field can be crucial in data science. Our general rule didn't work in the following cases:

- row 4: "Sud" should be "Sud Aviation"
- row 7: "McDonnell" should be "McDonnell Douglas"
- row 5,6 & 12 Are all examples of where the manufacturer was embedded later in the string

Let's deal with them in turn by mutating the manufacturer column on a case-by-case basis. This can be done with the helper function `case_when()` - pay attention to the special use of `==` and `~`:

```{r mutate manufacturer with case_when}
stowaway <- 
  stowaway %>% 
  # general rule
  mutate(manufacturer = str_extract(aircraft, "^.+?\\b")) %>% 
  # exceptions
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when(manufacturer == "Sud" ~ "Sud_Aviation",
                                  manufacturer == "McDonnell" ~ "McDonnell_Douglas",
                                  manufacturer == "BWIA" ~ "Lockhead",
                                  manufacturer == "U" ~ "Lockhead",
                                  manufacturer == "US" ~ "Boeing", 
                                  TRUE ~ manufacturer))
```

Let's now turn to extract the model of each aircraft. 

>
>As a general rule, where can we find the details for the model of the aircraft?
>

This is a bit trickier because the list of exceptions seems quite long, but as a starting point, let's remove the **manufacturer** details which identified as a genreal rule just now. This time we use the function `str_remove()`:

```{r}
stowaway %>% 
  transmute(model = str_remove(aircraft, "^.+?\\b")) %>% 
  distinct(model) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```

This has removed most of the manufacturers, with some exceptions and with some extra details we don't want as well. The following code deals with the exceptions in a case-by-case way too, but rather than creating new strings for each case, it just removes the unwanted details. Try to work out which row(s) in the tibble above each line deals with:

```{r}
stowaway <- 
  stowaway %>% 
  # general rule
  mutate(model = str_remove(aircraft, "^.+?\\b")) %>% 
  # exceptions
  mutate(model = str_remove(model,"Aviation "),
         model = str_remove(model,"Douglas "),
         model = str_remove(model, "Military Boeing "),
         model = str_remove(model,"\\.S\\. Air Force Lockheed "),
         model = str_remove(model," West Indies Airways Lockheed "),
         model = str_remove(model, "-\\d{3,}.*?$"), 
         model = str_remove(model, "\\[\\d+\\]$"),
         # one of my favourite functions for deleting extra whitespaces
         model = str_squish(model))
```

Finally, let's combine our cleaned-up `manufacturer` and `model` variables back together again by mutating over the `aircraft` column with a pasted version of the two, and then plot a new count of the aircraft. Note that when we use `paste()` here, we specify the separator as an underbar using the `sep = "_"` argument.

```{r}
stowaway %>% 
  mutate(aircraft = paste(manufacturer, model, sep="_")) %>% 
  count(aircraft) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  # very useful code to reorder before plotting - keep a note!
  mutate(aircraft = fct_reorder(aircraft, n)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, aircraft)) +
  geom_col()
```


## More involved questions

Let's now turn to some other data. The `stowaways_fate` column shows text that explains in detail the fate of the stowaway. In order to process that, we need to do some manipulation on the text strings using the `stringr` package.

![](../figures/table_to_str.png)
A quick look at the `stowaways_fate` reveals that the words **survived** and **died** are used to indicate what happened to the stowaways. We can use the function `stringr::str_detect()` to detect when shorter text strings (such as "survived") are present in longer passages of text (such as each row of `stowaways_fate`). If detected, it will return a TRUE value, if not FALSE.

```{r detect survived}
stowaway_fate <- 
stowaway %>% 
    mutate(survived = str_detect(stowaways_fate, "[Ss]urvived")) %>%
    mutate(died = str_detect(stowaways_fate, "[Dd]ied")) 
 stowaway_fate
```

In the code, you may notice that we searched for "[Ss]urvived" and "[Dd]ied". This is an example of a **regular expression**, often shortened to **regex**, which is one of the most fundamental ideas behind processing text data on a computer - used by all computer programming languages, and even every time you do a Google search.

>
> What do you think [Ss] or [Dd] means?
>

Here, the square brackets mean **capture any item from this [ ] group of characters**. In other words, `[Ss]urvived` will detect each time either "Survived" or "survived" are in the text string.

Note that however many characters are in the square brackets, it will only caprture one at a time. For example, `[Oo]saka` would capture either "Osaka" and "osaka", but not "Oosaka."

If you wanted to capture "Oosaka" too, the you can use the **regex** `[Oo]+saka`. Here, the `+` sign means **plus any number of the same**, so `[Oo]+saka` would capture "Oosaka" as well as "OoOoOsaka".

Let's see whether we get consistent results with these new columns. You would not expect for `survived` and `died` to be true at the same time, so let's filter on both those columns and see. Remember, when you use `dplyr::filter()`, you return only the rows for which the condition is `TRUE`, so if you filter on a column of logical variables, you drop all the `FALSE` rows.

```{r}
stowaway_fate %>% 
  filter(survived) %>%
  filter(died) %>% 
  select(stowaways_fate)
```

It looks like we have three cases in which more than one stowaway met with different fates. This means that each row may contain more than one observation, which goes against the principle of **tidy data**, and may be something we want to address later.

Rather than increase the number of rows in our data, instead we will just be careful to define our terms: each row then is a recorded incident of wheel-well stowaways occuring, and the "survived" and "died" variables can be changed to "somebody_survived" and "somebody_died".

How about the other case where both of the new columns are `FALSE`? 
```{r}
stowaway_fate %>% 
  ## Return a TRUE value even though the value is FALSE
  filter(survived == FALSE) %>%
  filter(died == FALSE) %>% 
  select(stowaways_fate)
```

Sadly in this case, a fatality occured, so let's add some text to this column and then rerun the `str_detect` code from above again.

```{r}
stowaway_fate <- 
  stowaway %>% 
  mutate(stowaways_fate = str_replace(stowaways_fate, pattern = "death", replacement = "death and died")) %>% 
  mutate(somebody_survived = str_detect(stowaways_fate, "[Ss]urvived")) %>%
    mutate(somebody_died = str_detect(stowaways_fate, "[Dd]ied")) 

```

Quick check we have no uncounted rows:
```{r}

   stowaway_fate %>% 
  ## Return a TRIE value even though the value is FALSE
  filter(somebody_survived == FALSE) %>%
  filter(somebody_died == FALSE)
  
```

## Processing the filght information

Now let's return to the routes. As before, when checking out some part of the data, it is worth just selecting the columns of interest and also an id column. 
```{r}
zxc <- stowaway %>% 
  select(date,flight)

zxc
```

A quick look at the flight column reveals that several routes include the names or airlines in brakcets. These will be identified and counted differently to the same routes without the brackets, and don't add any information that we need for now, so let's remove them with `str_remove()` which searches for a pattern, then removes it.

```{r}
zxc <- zxc %>% 
  mutate(flight = str_remove(flight, "\\(.+\\)"))
```

Again, we have used some **regex**, this time though it is a bit harder to understand at first glance. Some characters in regex have special meaning. We saw earlier that `[ ]` had the meaning of selecting characters from a group, and that `+` had the meaning of **plus any number of the same**.

In  **regex** :

- `.` can mean **any character (wildcard)**
- `+` can mean **plus any number of the same**
- `(` can mean **beginning of a string group**
- `)` can mean **end of a string group**

Becuase the `( )`  has a special meaning in **regex**, we have to do something extra to escape that special meaning, and only capture the **literal** left-hand and right-hand brackets. That is what the `\\` do - they escape the normal  function of `( )`, and let us capture the literal characters instead.

So to read `\\(.+\\)` as **regex**, you can say aloud: "capture the **literal left-hand bracket then any character repeatedly until a literal right-hand bracket**." 

```{r}
zxc %>% count(flight, sort = TRUE)
```

Looking at the counts of the flight column again, it looks like there is a pattern of **Departure-Destination** for the routes. Let's test this by counting the `-` signs, and seeing what we get:

```{r}
zxc %>% 
  mutate(dash = str_count(flight,"-"))%>% 
arrange(-dash)
```

Hmm, we have discovered two problems here. The first is that "Pointe-à-Pitre" has two `-` in it's name. The other is that most routes do not seem to have any dashes at all, even though we can see them right there! What is going on?

If you copy one of the apparently ignored dashes and paste into the code above, you'll see that there are actually two different dashes in the flight column.

```{r}
zxc %>% 
  mutate(dash = str_count(flight,"–"))%>% 
arrange(-dash)
```


```{r}
zxc <- 
  zxc %>% 
  mutate(flight = str_replace(flight,"a-B","a–B")) %>% 
  mutate(flight = str_replace_all(flight,"–","_")) 


zxc %>% 
  mutate(count = str_count(flight,"_")) %>% 
arrange(count)
```

Now let's deal with all  those with 0 count values, which are the routes with missing departure or destination information

```{r}
 zxc <- 
  zxc %>% 
  mutate(flight = str_replace(flight,"^To\\s", "Unlisted_")) %>% 
  mutate(flight = str_replace(flight, "\\sto\\sthe\\s", "_")) %>% 
  mutate(flight = str_replace(flight, "Kabul, Afghanistan", "Kabul_Unlisted"))
```

Let's look at some of the  **regex** here:

- `^`  is an *anchor* character that means **start of string**
- `\\s`  means **any whitespace character**

Therefore `^To\\s` is **regex** to capture when a string starts with "To" and is followed by a space, or `To `.

For reference:

- `$`  is an *anchor* character that means **end of string**
- `\\w`  means **any word character**

Now we are very close to being able to separate the filght column into two new ones: one for departure cities and one for destinations. 

The general pattern we have is `Departure_Destination`, but it is slightly confused by the fact that some of the flights also have stoppovers at midpoint destinations, as revealed when arranging a count of underscores in descending order:

```{r}
zxc %>% mutate(count = str_count(flight, "_")) %>% 
  arrange(-count) 
```

We'll deal with that soon, but first lets use some more **regex** to grab the two columns we want:

```{r}
zxc %>% 
  tidyr::extract(flight, into = c("dept","dest"), regex = "^(.+?)_(.+?)$") 
```

How does this **regex** work? Well, we've seen these characters before:

- `^`  is an *anchor* character that means **start of string**
- `$`  is an *anchor* character that means **end of string**
- `.` can mean **any character (wildcard)**
- `+` can mean **plus any number of the same**
- `(` can mean **beginning of a string group**
- `)` can mean **end of a string group**

Here we actually want the `( )` for their functional usage. The **regex** `^(.+)_(.+)$` captures two groups withing the brackets, which form the two columns extracted by the `tidyr` function. The separator `_` is not captured.

But what happened to all the transit stops?

```{r}
zxc %>% 
  tidyr::extract(flight, into = c("dept","dest"), regex = "^(.+)_(.+)$") %>% 
  arrange(-nchar(dept))
```

They were all captured in the first group, so let's make a new column to take care of them.


```{r}
zxc %>% 
  tidyr::extract(flight, into = c("dept","dest"), regex = "^(.+?)_(.+)$") %>% 
  tidyr::extract(dest, into = c("transit", "dest2"), regex = "(.+)_(.+?)$", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  transmute(date,dept, transit, dest = ifelse(is.na(transit), dest,dest2)) %>% 
    arrange(-nchar(transit))
```
