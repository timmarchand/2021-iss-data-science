# MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS IN R  --------------------------------------------

## Also known as bootstrapping
## Very first baby steps in Machine Learning!

## 1 SAMPLING AND REPLICATING ----
# make a vector of names
# Change these names to match this class members names!
names <- c("member_1","member_2","member_3","member_4")
names
# use sample to pick two names at random
sample(names, size = 2, replace = FALSE)

# set replace = TRUE to put names back in the hat
sample(names, size = 5, replace = TRUE)

## You may have different results because it is random!
## We can control that by setting the seed - this regularises random number generation
## Set seed
set.seed(111)
sample(names, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
sample(names, size = 5, replace = TRUE)

## What could this represent?
sample(1:6,1) # no need for replace argument as only taking one sample

## to represent rolling 2 dice
sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)

## save as a variable score
roll <- sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
roll
## to get the total, use sum()
sum(roll)

## same as above, but in one line
sum(sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE))


## create a simple function to represent rolling 2 dice and adding them
two_dice <- function(){ # use curly brackets open on the same line as function()
  roll <- sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE) # create a variable within the function
  return(sum(roll)) # this is the value returned
} # close on the last line by itself
two_dice()
### Use replicate() to repeat a function
replicate(n = 3, getwd()) ## replicating the getwd() function 3 times

## repeat our two_dice function nine times
replicate(n = 4, two_dice())

# save as a vector
scores <- replicate(n = 4, two_dice())
scores
# average of scores?
mean(scores)
median(scores)

# how diverse are the scores?
range(scores) # returns the lowest and highest values
table(scores) # get a frequency table of scores
sd(scores) # standard deviation - useful for statistics
hist(scores) # simple histogram

## DIY 1
##Experiment with changing the n value and plotting  simple histograms
scores <- replicate(n = , two_dice())
hist(scores)


# 2 More plotting simulations ----

# simple histogram of scores
hist(scores) # same as our frequency table

# why not use ggplot?
ggplot(data = scores, aes(x=scores)) +
  geom_histogram()  # Error: `data` must be a data frame!

# lets make a df combining names and scores to use with ggplot
scores <- replicate(n = 4, two_dice())
df <- tibble(name = names,
             score = scores)

# now we can use ggplot to make the histogram
ggplot(data = df, aes(x=score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, colour = "white") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:12, limits = c(1,12)) # sets the x axis

## ...in case you are curious about your own score!
ggplot(data = df, aes(x=name, y=score)) +
  geom_col() + # geom_col creates a simple bar chart
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:12, limits = c(0,12)) # sets the y axis

## Simulating several rolls of the dice

## another function, this time combining replicate() and two_dice()
test_2_dice <- function(n){ # with an input variable n + number of replications
  test <- tibble(roll = 1:n,
                 score =replicate(n,two_dice()))
  return(test)
}

t_5<- test_2_dice(5)
t_50<- test_2_dice(50)
t_5000 <- test_2_dice(5000)

mean(t_5$score)
mean(t_50$score)
mean(t_5000$score)

median(t_5$score)
median(t_50$score)
median(t_5000$score)


## because test_2_dice creates a df, you can put the result straight into ggplot
test_2_dice(20) %>% # this is the piping operator - easily confused with +!
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = score) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, colour = "white")


## in fact, you can even add plotting when making a function
plot_2_dice <- function(n){
  test <- tibble(throw = 1:n,
                 score = replicate(n,two_dice()))
  ggplot(test) +
    aes(x = score) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1L, fill = "#0c4c8a", colour = "white") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:12, limits = c(0,14)) +
    ggtitle(paste("Histogram after",as.character(n),"rolls", sep = " ")) +
    theme_minimal()
}

## play around with the plot_2_dice() function, changing the values of n
## what is the trend for the higher the value of n?
plot_2_dice()


## Let's check our intuition by comparing the histograms with the normal distribution
## full plotting with density plot and normal distribution comparison

norm_2_dice <- function(n){
  # same code to run the test
  test <- tibble(throw = 1:n,
                 score = replicate(n,two_dice()))
  # plot the histogram for first plot, p1
  p1 <- ggplot(test) +
    aes(x = score) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1L, fill = "#0c4c8a", colour = "white") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:12, limits = c(0,14)) +
    ggtitle(paste("Histogram after",as.character(n),"rolls", sep = " ")) +
    theme_minimal()

  # plot a density plot for second plot, p2
  p2 <-ggplot(test) +
    aes(x = score) +
    geom_density( fill = "#0c4c8a", alpha = 0.5, adjust = logb(n,50)) + # adjust the density bandwidth according to sample size
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:12, limits = c(0,14)) +
    ggtitle("Density plot vs Normal distribution") +
    theme_minimal() +
    # add normal distribution based on mean and sd
    stat_function(colour = "red",
                  fun = dnorm,
                  args = list(mean = mean(test$score), sd = sd(test$score)))
  # put the plots together in one row
  grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
}

## check it out to see how it works
norm_2_dice(10)

### Creating a number of plots with the number of rolls
### Set to 5, 50, 500, 5000, 50000

# define a number of rolls for input into map()
# note that map() requires a list
rolls <- as.list(c(5,50,500,5000,50000))
# Create a list of plots based on the rolls
plots <- map(rolls, ~norm_2_dice(.x) )
# arrange plots with grid.arrange
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plots, list(ncol=1)))





# DIVERSIONS WITH OUR EXPERIMENTAL (RANDOM QUESTIONS) DATA ---------------------------------------------------

## diversion 1 ----

### create 2 data frames

df_all <- dat
df_class <-dat %>% filter(dat$iss_datasci) # filter returns only the rows with TRUE values

## extracting df columns as vectors using $
df_class$height ## this returns a vector of values
mean(df_class$height) ## this returns the mean
median(df_class$height) ## this returns the median
max(df_class$height) ## this returns the maximum value
min(df_class$height) ## this returns the minimum value
var(df_class$height) ## this returns the variance of the data
sd(df_class$height) ## this returns the standard deviation
IQR(df_class$height) ## this returns the the interquartile range


## use attach() to avoid typing!
## this is especially useful if you are only working on one df
attach(df_class)
height ## this returns a vector of values
mean(height) ## this returns the mean
median(height) ## this returns the median
max(height) ## this returns the maximum value
min(height) ## this returns the minimum value
var(height) ## this returns the variance of the data
sd(height) ## this returns the standard deviation
IQR(height) ## this returns the the interquartile range


# create a simple df of the results
class_height_summary <- tibble(mean = mean(height), ## this returns the mean
                                   median = median(height), ## this returns the median
                                   max = max(height), ## this returns the maximum value
                                   min =  min(height), ## this returns the minimum value
                                   var = var(height), ## this returns the variance of the data
                                   sd = sd(height), ## this returns the standard deviation
                                   IQR(height)) ## this returns the the interquartile range )



# As with many things in R, there are already some nice functions
## For example summary()
summary(height)

## use table to get frequency counts on categorical data
table(month) # note the output is in alphabetical order
# make month a factor with levels
table(factor(month, levels = month.name)) ## just once
month <- factor(month, levels = month.name) ## or change the column in the df
## use prop.table on the table to get proportions
prop.table(table(month))
## note you have to make a table first
prop.table(month) ## Error message â€˜sumâ€™ not meaningful for factors
## use round for fewer digits
round(prop.table(table(month)), 2)
# note how the functions work from the centre out, like in Excel

## IMPORTANT - don't forget to detach after using attach!
detach(df_class)

## CHALLENGE now do the same exploration for  df_all
## Notice anything odd about df_all?



## diversion 2 ----

## Answering the question about height...
## Explore the class height variables with a box plot
## Does the plot suggest there is a difference in heights depending on
## if you are born on an even or odd date?
ggplot(df_class) +
  aes(x = "", y = height, fill = birthday) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_hue() +
  labs(x = "Birthday", y = "Height in cm") +
  ggtitle(paste("Boxplot of height by odd/even birthday for this class, n =",
                as.character(nrow(df_class), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()
## But is n enough to make that judgement?

## Explore the class height variables with a density plot
ggplot(df_class) +
  aes(x = height) +
  geom_density(adjust = 0.5, fill = "#0c4c8a") +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density") +
  ggtitle(paste("Density plot of height by odd/even birthday for this class, n =",
                as.character(nrow(df_class), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()
## Is the height variable bimodial? A combination of two separate groups?

## Let's check by separating the number variable as fill
## Also add "rugs" just to show where the data lies
ggplot(df_class) +
  aes(x = height, fill = birthday) +
  geom_density(adjust = 0.5,alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_rug(aes(colour=birthday)) +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density") +
  ggtitle(paste("Density plot of height by odd/even birthday for this class, n =",
                as.character(nrow(df_class), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()

## The density plot shows both variables are far from normal (as might be expected)
# It will be difficult to get a reliable statistical measure from this


## Let's see if the full dataset is better
ggplot(df_all) +
  aes(x = height) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1, fill = "#0c4c8a") +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density") +
  ggtitle(paste("Density plot of height by odd/even birthday for this class, n =",
                as.character(nrow(df_all), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()

## Something strange going on here
## but is height still somehow associated with date of birth number?

## Explore the class height variables with a density plot
ggplot(df_all) +
  aes(x = height, fill = birthday) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1,alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_rug(aes(colour=birthday)) +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density") +
  ggtitle(paste("Density plot of height by odd/even birthday for this class, n =",
                as.character(nrow(df_class), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()

## And with a boxplot
ggplot(df_all) +
  aes(x = "", y = height, fill = birthday) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_hue() +
  labs(x = "Birthday", y = "Height in cm") +
  ggtitle(paste("Boxplot of height by odd/even birthday for this class, n =",
                as.character(nrow(df_all), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()

## Clearly we have an outlier!
## In the last diversion, you may have already found it

## Depending on the data, not always okay to remove outliers
## But this experimental data was clearly just a typo

##Removing the outlier ----
# tidyverse method
df_all <- df_all %>% filter(height > 7)
# Base R method
df_all<- df_all[df_all$height>7,]

## Try the boxplot again
ggplot(df_all) +
  aes(x = "", y = height, fill = birthday) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_hue() +
  labs(x = "Birthday date", y = "Height in cm", title = "Boxplot of height by odd/even birthday") +
  theme_minimal()
## Still potentially different somehow...

## Density plot again
ggplot(df_all) +
  aes(x = height, fill = birthday) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1,alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_rug(aes(colour=birthday)) +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density", title = "Are people's heights related to birthday dates?", fill = "birthday date") +
  theme_minimal()

## Much more overlap - with < n data points, unlikely to be significant


## Official data ----
## from the jpn_ht dataset

## We can generate approximate datasets of height survey data
## Using the mean and standard deviation values and simulating it
## These values comes from
# male heights
# m_norm <- round(rnorm(n = 1708,mean = 172, sd = 5.42),1)
# # female heights
# f_norm <- round(rnorm(n = 1559, mean = 158.7, sd = 5.3),1)
# # make a df. with the heights, some id numbers and sex variable
# jpn_ht <- tibble(id = sample(1:3267,3267,replace = FALSE),
#                    sex = c(rep("male",1708),rep("female",1559)),
#                    height = c(m_norm,f_norm))
# jpn_ht <- jpn_ht %>% arrange(id)
# write_csv(jpn_ht,"data/jpn_height_survey.csv")

glimpse(jpn_ht)

## Density plot for height
p1 <- ggplot(jpn_ht) +
  aes(x = height) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1, fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density") +
  ggtitle(paste("Density plot of heights in Japan, n =",
                as.character(nrow(jpn_ht), sep =" "))) +
  theme_minimal()
p1

## The two points in the plot means the data look bimodial
## This means there may be 2 separate populations..

## Let's check by plotting 2 density plots
## Using fill to separate the sexes
p2 <- ggplot(jpn_ht) +
  aes(x = height, fill = sex) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1L, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Height in cm", y = "Probability Density") +
  scale_fill_hue() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
p2

## put the plots together
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2)

## This strongly suggests we should consider sex as a factor
## when collecting data for height (no surprise there)

## A boxplot confirms this suspicion
ggplot(jpn_ht) +
  aes(x = "", y = height, fill = sex) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_hue() +
  labs( y = "Height in cm", title = "Boxplot of heights in Japan") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
## With such a large number of datapoints, we can assume we are dealing with
## two distinct populations even before doing any statistics

## Finally, let's compare the means
compare_heights <- tibble(class_average = mean(df_class$height),
                          survey_average = mean(df_all$height),
                          jpn_average = mean(jpn_ht$height))

compare_heights
## Did the larger sample from the survey do a better job of matching the population mean?

## 2 BIRTHDAY PARADOX ----

## R actually has a function which calculates the probability of people in a group sharing a birthday
?pbirthday

## probability of > 2 people with the same birthday in a group of 23
pbirthday(n = 23, coincident = 2)
pbirthday(n = 100, coincident = 2)

## Without knowing the mathematics behind this, we can use monte carlo simulation

## create group size from 2 to 100, even numbers only
people = seq(2, 100, 2)
## create 10000 random trials
trial = 1:10000
## cross each over into new df
trials <- crossing(trial,people)
trials
## calculate chance

## take the large df
chance_summary <- trials %>%
  ## add birthday list column with a random sample of days
  mutate(birthday = map(people, ~ sample(365, ., replace = TRUE)),
         ## find out if any are duplicated
         multiple = map_lgl(birthday, ~ any(duplicated(.)))) %>%
  ## group by size of group
  group_by(people) %>%  ## use mean of logic vector to calculate probablilty
  summarize(chance = mean(multiple))


## Visualizing the probability -------------------------------------------
ggplot(chance_summary, aes(people, chance)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(y = "Probability two have the same birthday")

## Compare simulated with mathematical probabilities
